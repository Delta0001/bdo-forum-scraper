Our team will be monitoring this thread daily to ensure all relevant feedback is collected and sent to the developers.\n \nWe ask that you provide your suggestions using the following template:\n\n\nFamily Name:Region (NA/EU):Class (Awakening/Succession):Suggestion:Details:\nPlease limit the suggestion to a single skill or topic, but feel free to post multiple suggestions! Suggestions concerning broader topics should include specific details on improvements. When sending your feedback, please be as detailed as possible. Media such as video and screenshots are also encouraged!\n \nComments that do not follow the template above will be deleted as the purpose of this post is to organize and collect your feedback. If you would like to discuss your class with your fellow adventurers, please make a separate discussion post in this Class Discussion Board and include the relevant class hashtags!\n \nExample of good feedback:\nFamily Name: [CM]VedirRegion: NAClass: Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: Dark Knight PvE Improvement IdeasDetails: Succession Dark Knight is underperforming in PvE, mainly at high end monster zones like Elvia Calpheon. Please increase her damage by increasing the critical hit chance of Absolute: Corrupt Ground from 50% to 100% in PvE. Her sustain could also be improved so I suggest increasing the HP and MP recovery from 40 to 50 and add an 40 HP recovery per hit effect to Absolute: Flow Ravage Rake. These improvements to her sustain skills will help with making her grinding more manageable at high end monster zones.\nExample of bad feedback:\n\nFamily Name: [CM]VedirRegion: NAClass: Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: Buff Dark Knight PvEDetails: Buff Dark Knight's damage and lower her cooldowns.\nWe look forward to hearing your wonderful suggestions!"

        "content": "Family Name: GreenShadowPTRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): ShaiSuggestion: Full rework and redesign of the classDetails: I'm sorry to say this, but this class is utterly bad compared to the other classes, to the point of even not being considered a real class by many! We literally can't even be a effective support, because we lack the protections to survive so we can continue supporting the team, not to mention the heals arent that great, and then its rather impossible to play a tune mid battle without getting grabbed. The class is impossible to 1v1 anyone, we cant defend ourselves, as our damage is so weak. On top of that, the recent changes (Misty Haze wrongfully nerfed, and nerfed damage back to pre-reboot) just kills more the class. And seems like that will be in a loop of nerfing the class constantly in the future for some reason. The only thing we can do and rather bad, is PvE, and gets nerfed more and more (17% damage reduced in last nerf!) The class is very bad mobility wise, and is bad at most spots, except for a few end game spots. Also other issues like we don't have a Blackstar Sol, nor is it taggable, so we are stuck with it.Please, as i think this will get ignored, i would still ask at least to divide the class into Succesion and Awakening, succesion for those who want more grind and being able to pvp and such, having high APM. Awakening would be for those who still like the support aspect and want it. At least this, but the best would be a full rework."

        "content": "Family Name: AmaheRegion: NAClass: ShaiSuggestion: Yippee! improvementDetails: One of the many issues with Shai is our only mobility skill, Yippee! has a long CD as well as uses up a LOT of stamina. I have a few different suggestions for ways that Yippee! can be improved and provide more utility for Shais. The first is that Yippee! not use stamina when first used off CD, but can still be used even while on CD, but with the added cost of stamina and loss of SA, to be replaced with perhaps FG so as not to allow the ability to be too overpowered. Another idea is Yippee! can be channeled as long as you have the stamina to support it. And last but not least, the ability to use Yippee! as a channel skill at any giving time. Allowing you to use your Artina Sol while riding it but with the downside of being restricted from your main hand until your Florang is recalled. Allowing shai to use her talent tree while riding her Florang would allow for a better pvp experience. Since she struggles with mid to large scale fights, this change could have the potential of Shai having a more enjoyable pvp experience since Shai's ONLY engage tool is her 15 seconds Yippee!. Coasting through a ball while playing bongos sounds a lot more fun than slowly walking towards the enemy and hoping they walk into them."

        "content": "Family Name: Myserie\nRegion: NA\nClass: Awakening Guardian\nSuggestion: Better viability in high damage areas\n\nBackground: You've decided to model the Blackstar Offhand weapon to the Kutum which has more DP, more AP versus monsters and more penetration of resistances. However, in my experience survivability for the solo Awakened Guardian in difficult PVM areas requires as much resistances as possible to avoid knockdown, stun and overall crowd effects from monsters. I'm forced pick between having inadequate DP compared to people who take the Kutum/Blackstar approach or to get stunned and knocked down more than is sustainable on the solo toe-to-toe slow melee class. In addition, the Blackstar shield gets twice as much durability as the Nouver shield, and there is no equivalent offhand option for those who need Nouver for better tankiness.\n\nI like the slow style of the Guardian, but could you give us either skills or passive buffs which boost the tankiness. And do you really need to try to force everyone at high levels to use Kutum/Blackstar? Couldn't you allow for bettter freedom of gear choice? Thanks :)"

        "content": "Family Name: BallzDeeep69Region: NAClass: Succession Dark KnightSuggestion: Patching up holes in pvp performanceDetails: With the recent class buffs succ dk is acutally feels much better than before and is in a pretty good spot. Though there are some nitpicky things I want to touch on.\n\n1. Losing bound in pvp on obsidian ashes was a bit much. Pre-patch even though it was un protected, with phantasmal snare you could still get in some sneaky plays with it to start a combo. Now it just feels like another filler damage skill. Having both SA and bound in pvp would be preferable but if I had to pick one I would want the bound back. Losing bound on lunacy didn't change much though\n\n2: Move the \"1 target's guard gauge -20%\" to a different skill. Shadow bullet as is, is broken. In that half the time it colides with something the game doesn't even register it as a hit. I think slanted balance would be a good cantidate for this effect.\n\n3: Increase accuracy modifiers on all skills to a minimum of 10%. In my opinion if she's gonna fill the \"glass cannon\" role, none of her skills should be below that\n\n4: Wheel of fortune could use a down attack modifier. I don't think it makes much sense that an upward slash like slanted balance is a down attack but wheel isn't\n\n5: And lastly, this is quite annoying. At the end of vedir strike, if you're still holding W + F you immediately use unveiled dagger, even though when air strike is on CD and you press W + F again you don't use it, you have to just press F. This really screws up those last few frames of SA that are instead being interrupted by dagger because you didn't take you're finger off the F key in time"

This has the same base stats as a Dandelion weapon, but unlike a Dande, it cannot be bought or sold on the Central Market, cannot be tagged to or from any character (even Shai to Shai), can't be exchanged via Weapon Exchange coupons, can't be Caphras'd, and can't be guaranteed PEN'd via Jetina. There is no Blackstar or Godr-Eyed Sol.\n\nWhile Shai's DR shred is good (-35 is ~15 DR better than most classes' -20), it does not make up for the loss of stats on our Awakening Weapon:* +10 species damage (random 7-10 base damage) on Blackstar OR 12 species damage (random 8-12 base damage) on Dandelion* +25 Monster AP on PEN Blackstar / Godr-Eyed* +12 accuracy at PEN Blackstar or Dandelion c20\n\nAll damage numbers are in base damage, which gets scaled by the skill percent per-hit. While Monster AP from Blackstar becomes less effective (~50-70%) over a grindspot's AP softcap, both DR shred and species damage are both very effective over this softcap. Shai's DR shred is not inherently overpowered. All of this was confirmed on Global Labs with damage numbers on.\n\nPlease release Dandelion & Blackstar Sols! Give Shais an opportunity to pay silver to exchange their Artina, and treat Sol the same as any other class's Awakening Weapon.\n\nedit: corrected spelling of 'Blackstar'"

        "content": "Family Name: YberDCRegion: EUClass: Warrior (Awakening)Suggestion: PvE ImprovementsDetails: Awakening warrior is underwhelming in PvE, very high effort, low reward. Currently, a very high effort (high APM and using animation cancels) Awakening Warrior grinder obtains between 10 and 35% less loot than most other classes in PvE (exacervated on endgame spots) on a similar, or often times, lower level of effort. The main problems are a raw lack of damage and very slow animations (low damage per second), which can't be fixed with something like critical chance adjustements, because most skills have (or can reach) 100% already, and Awakening Warrior runs out of skills to use, even with these slow animations. To fix the problem, I suggest applying any combination of these changes, NOT all of them simultaneously.\n\n- Gravedigging: Increase animation speed by x1.5 (make it 50% faster than it is now) OR increase damage per hit/number of hits (adjust PvP damage modifier accordingly), reduce cooldown from 8 to 7 seconds. The damage on the skill is fine, but the animation is far too long. With the massive nerfs to the skill on PvP, it won't change much on that area.\n- Flow: Slashing the Dead: better hit registration, goes over small obstacles, more hits for more overall damage (adjust PvP damage modifier accordingly). The skill often misses entirely due to the very bad hitbox detection (particularly when there's any kind of elevation present), and when it hits, the damage is underwhelming at best. It's also very counter intuitive that a branch on the ground is able to stop the character in place when he's spinning in the air. The cooldown is fine, does not need adjustements.\n- Flow:Reckless Blow: remove the chargeup timer and make it instant cast with full damage OR increase damage by 50% (adjust PvP modifier accordingly), and decrease cooldown from 10 to 8 seconds (currently this skill acts as bottleneck for PvE combos due to it's long cooldown). It's the only skill with tier 3 addons in for the class and it's painfully slow to use, with very low damage for a windup skill.\n- Frenzied Strikes: remove bound effect in PvP, remove knockback effect from PvE, forward guard without core skill, 40% damage increase (adjust PvP modifier accordingly), critical hit damage buff duration up by +3 seconds from what it is now. This skill exists exclusively for PvE and it's extremely underwhelming, with low damage and an extremely slow animation, but we HAVE to use it during combos to not run out of cooldowns.\n- Flow: Heaven's Cleave: 50% PvE damage increase, +5% extra back attack damage for 7 seconds (adjust PvP modifier accordingly).\n- Flow: Hilt Strike: remove stiff effect in PvP, add forward guard, add +2 hits in PvE or equivalent damage modifier increase. This skill is necesary in spots that require high accuracy, but it deals next to no damage and is unprotected, so most players lock it and forgen it's existance.\n- Balance strike: add +4 hits in PvE (from 3 to 7) or equivalent damage modifier increase, add 100% critical hit chance PvE only. Currently, most people use it as filler damage or as movement between packs. The AoE damage on it is tiny, but this makes it worth using during combos and in spots like Gyfin Underground or Quint Hill.\n- Pulverize and Flow: Tempest: add +3 hits in PvE (from 7 to 10). It's the ONLY forward guard ability in Awakening (provided you don't go through with the Frenzied Strikes changes) while also being the ONLY sustain ability for the class. While the sustain and protections are fine, it should be able to finish off leftover mobs, as once used, we're out of PvE protection.\n\nThese changes are not meant to be applied all at once, but to give a decent selection of possible buffs to PvE for the class to pick from. Fundamentally, the problems are low damage coupled with low damage per second, but simply increasing damage numbers and animation speed will result in running out of cooldowns, thus cooldown adjustements are needed in tandem."

        "content": "Family Name: Remminia\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Shai(Talent)\nSuggestion: Sprinkle-Sparkle should apply -10% Forward Guard\nDetails: Shai is clearly intended to be a “Jack of all trades” support class. This becomes apparent if you take into account her skills: She has one of the fastest skills in the game, but it has a long windup and is completely unprotected. She has heals; neither of them are even close to the healing skills of Wizard/Witch. She has good CC, but is completely immobile during it. She has good damage, but is completely unprotected during it and she has no Down Attack/Air Attacks. \nFitting with this concept Shai has several abilities that are super niche and I believe intentionally so: She has “Come out, Come out” which is a revealing skill that taunts mobs. She has “Gather Around” a purely PVE skill that pulls some mobs towards her. She has “We’re Gonna Win” which makes a lot of changes to how her talent abilities work. This is good design for a “Jack of all trades” support. However, she has a skill called Sprinkle-Sparkle.\n \nSprinkle-Sparkle is a useless skill in the modern day. Its mana drain is pointless, due to almost everyone carrying mana potions, and its mana restore is useless, for the same reason. This was not as true before the merge of potions, but now with 1 type of mana potion it is extremely uncommon to find someone who doesn’t have mana potions. Also in AoS the passive mana regen makes this ability useless.\n \nShai in PVP has major downsides already, and this is apparent in AOS. Shai’s damage abilities are very low, and Shai’s unprotected mobility leaves her to be focused and caught. Shai in PVP is not a strong class by any means. I am clarifying this now.\nShai can deal with high SA classes sometimes with her “Forest Echo” ability, as it is able to exploit gaps in combos. A skilled player can avoid having these gaps, so it's a fair mechanic with counterplay.\n \nShai has no ability to deal with Shield classes. These classes are Nova, Valk, Guardian, and Warrior. When these classes block, they get Super Armor. Even if a Shai is able to get around their backs, these classes will not be CCed. This leads to a unique PVP circumstance, where Shai has literally no ability to counter a class with a shield.\nLet's take the Best Shai player in the world, and pit them against the worst Shield class player in the world. Shai can not do anything to them until they leave the block. Shai has no ability to pressure them into engaging with her. So she stands and waits to catch the Shield user once the drop block. This gives the Shield class all the initiative. Skill does not matter in this case, the Shai has no ability to counterplay. The Shield class just walks up to the Shai and wins any engagement. The Shield class may make a major mistake, or move to the Shai unprotected, but this doesn’t have to happen. The worst Shield class can just walk at Shai and win.\nThis is a unique circumstance. There is no other case in the game where a player cannot use their skill to overcome a class difference in PVP. There are hard counters, like Nova vs Corsair, where the Corsair is more likely to win, but the Nova can win. The Nova can engage, the Nova has choices to how they play that will influence how the fight goes. The Corsair has the advantage, but is prone to being engaged on and messing up.\n \nSo for Shai, I propose changing Sprinkle-Sparkle to give a -10% Forward Guard.This gives a Shai the ability to pressure, while still being extremely weak in this matchup. A Shai would have to be completely unprotected for casting Sprinkle-Sparkle 10 times to truly break a Forward Guard. This would take around 10 seconds to do. This gives the Shield user plenty of time to engage on Shai and punish her for doing this, but it gives Shai the ability to force the Shield class to confront her. In forcing this confrontation, the best Shai player would now beat the worst Shield class player, as she has the ability to engage the fight.\n \nWhen Corsair came out everyone thought their Guard Break would be too strong, and Node Wars would consist only of Corsairs. This clearly did not happen. I think the community might be concerned with a change like this, but would quickly realize this ability is on Shai.\n \nThis also has the added benefit of adding supportive skills to the support class, which just makes sense."

As it is now people see awakened caster and their first thought it to go straight for them knowing they can't do much to stop them and that problem kinda multiplies many times over when that teleport spell is used.\nClass needs some help as it is inferior to its succession spec in literally ALL forms of PvP.  It is virtually all but dead spec in EU at the moment. \nSuggestions that should be considered:- increase duration (or lower cooldown)of Mana shield for awakened spec\n\n- add extra charge(s) on awakened skill Flow: magical evasion\n\n- add command to use Elementalization from staff stance- make pets use all your stats, including %damage modifiers like from corrupted gems. Sucks to have such large of your kit not using all your gear? why is this even happening?\n- iron out class modifiers  - > some classes simply ignore us due to having big advantage there and they also have bit kit advantage fighting us to begin with\n- maybe remove downsmash from Calling of Fire and give it FG and some (+20%)+critical chance buff over 10 sec- remove airsmash from Flow: Aqua bomb, also, why does it have split damage in 2017? I know people didnt look kindly at Water sphere and its flow being spammed from castle walls like 5 years back but today its totally weird to put this restriction on this class spec.- awa wizard has crap ranged options as it is. its supposed to be middle range class afaik, and very few of its spells reeach further than a bit wider melee coupled with atrocious reposition options.\n- maybe put T3 addon on Awakened version of Bolide of destruction? somehow improve the spell at least, succession version is legit few times better and faster skill. Also, if u BON it, it doesnt apply down attack on its own cc from KD.\n- rework Chilling wave, it is simply not good skill and its frontal guard is dubious at best, also very weak block bar. Takes forever to apply damage in todays meta. Also, every other class today seems to have some sort of FG penetration, blockjump or simply goes through fg for whatever reason vs this long static skill with actually disappointing dps. If its supposed to be some sorf of big damage finisher skill, it is failing in its job. see sorceres skill cartian nightmare for refernece. Theres a way better way it was done.\n- Hellfire gets stopped under enemy hits since forever ( https://streamable.com/8sk19v ). Remove friendly collision at least from the skill. Make your character not drop from tiniest elevation distance if u used hellfire from some height ( https://streamable.com/oua5ay ). It even gets stuck on corpses on the floor! Make 50% BSR  Hellfire version gain SA. Its useless at the moment. Also make BSR version chain Magma bomb and Flame knot as original spell.-Flame knot often lacks range to connect to Hellfire, which is its combo connection spell by design. https://streamable.com/tr9455  Adjust a tiny little bit so that this doesnt happen because its actually sad now and is self grief. \n-FIX skills not working on slopes/elevations? Our skills are long and take long to cast and often even then they don't connect with enemies due to Y axis issues. It is often feeling we are self CCing ourselves and doing nothing to people unless terrain is flat and nice, and you know that isn't happening often in nodewar/siege scenarios.\n\n\np.s. it wouldnt be bad if mana pool for the class was increased without us needing to sacrifice lightstone set. i dont see other classes having basically locked lightstone sets for them. mana level hasnt been raised since 2017 basically, beside this 4xmindstone set.\n\n\nNot that it matters, but it might be relevant - I'm speaking from 732 gs perspective, meaning that there aint much left that can be done via gear beside few % in one way or another for some stuff. Also, might be important to note that most GEARED players avoid this class spec like plague as gear on it doesnt feel nearly as impactfull as on other classes so thier efforts and gear is better used on more fortunate/better designed classes."

Biggest issue are the limited protected movement capabilities and the much lower damage of skills like Violation compared to the awakening sorc version. \nImprovements I would like to see to make the class more accessible:\nSA on Prime Midnight Stinger: Awakening sorc has more movement and protected movement capabilities. Making Prime Midnight Stinger SA would at least make protected movement a little less challenging. Or give us Core Skills to put extra protection onto a skill we choose.\nReduce Crow Flare cooldown to 1 second: Succession sorc does not have an S-Block so it is impossible to stay protected for a longer amount of time. The 2 second cooldown prevents us from at least having an easy playable combination of Crow Flare->Night Crow->Crow Flare to have some protection. Instead we have to rotate somethine like Crow Flare->Night Crow->Rushing Crow->Violation->Crow Flare->Night Crow->Dark Flame->Night Crow->Crow Flare to manage the cooldowns, which is very easy to screw up. \nGive us an S-Block: Alternative to the reduced Crow Flare cooldown, just give us an S-Block that more or less all other classes have. There is no reason for succ sorc not to have an S-Block.\nAdjust the PVP damage: Succession sorc already has a lot less damage skills than awakening sorc so at least let the skills she has do the same damage in PVP. There is absolutely no excuse that the prime version of a skill does less damage than the absolute version of the skill. \n\nI am sure there could be more but these are my personal biggest issues."

        "content": "Family Name: PhelsongRegion: NAClass: ShaiSuggestion: Shai Psuedo ReworkDetails: Shai is and has been underperforming in ALL content save a couple of very endgame pve spots. She breaks things are some extremes or niche situations, but is just bad in almost every other area of the game. Shais core issues lie in excessive cooldowns and a handful of buggy mechanics. What I would suggest is basically a proper rework, as it stands right now Shai will not be buffed in a way that makes her effective for the majority of players.____-- We're Gonna Win needs a rework in general. It doesnt function properly; stuff cancels itself randomly, moving causes songs to double cast, movement abilities cancel songs but dont actually..., and the list goes on.I would suggest making the Songs have the Ranged component and melee aura componenet by default, rework WgW to do something else beneficial. possible options...---- 1: (more) additional bongo damage at the cost of some utility---- 2: Added Tute (flute) song effects at the cost of damage---- 3: protections at the cost of damage---- 4: self Defense at the cost of damage---- 5: Change Song effects in some interesting way---- 6: Single use Skill augment---- 7: 3-5 sec Super Armor group buff---- 8: some combination of any of the above\n-- Tam Tam (Bongo) skills simply do not do enough damage or have enough utility to justify their usage outside of simple PvP cc and are legitimately a DPS loss in basically any usage.---- Bongo Damage should be buffed at least 100%, if not more, on all 3. I would reccomend +30-50% damage boost, plus 30% crit rate, plus down attack added.---- IF ^ damage is buffed, Getting addons for these skills would be a nice perk.---- With mobility and protection creep after reboots, the CC components are just not as effective as they used to be. Damage is too high, I would suggest adding some inherent DR% to all 3 (or at least Echo)[+20% DR rate while playing bongo?], so they are useable without simply being killed thru them.---- Sun's Fury slow is just not competetive for a support class, numerous classes have 30%+ and almost every class has easily accessible 20%. This is not adequate utility for the handful of skills we have.I would suggest buffing the slow to -35% [by adding +15% to Sol, making up for reducing Haze bonus][doing it this way also keeps it to -31% in solare]\n-- Misty Haze nerf was too excessive and greatly dimished the class's playstyle. Missing the skill via FG, movement, or just poor aim and being locked out for 3 whole minutes is too punishing. Plus, we want to play a bard, let us play music.I would suggest reducing the rate to 15%/15% [with Pen Artina], reducing the cooldown/duration back to 20 seconds, and reduce the stacking effect with Rang to -20 in PvE and PvP (and Rang not stacking with other classes -dp). [by reducing Sol bonus to +5% at Pen]\n---- ^ ie make Hop3, Twirl3, and Kwik2: -20 All DP in PvE and PvP\n-- Delusive i would also suggest reducing to 20 sec cooldown to match, its one of the few powerful skills we have to change a group fight. I would also like to see the -ap buffed to -35 and the -crit chance% reduced to 35% (to compensate somewhat)-- I would love to see another Tring (lute) song that has a -healing% and/or potent a Damage over Time effect. \n-: 20 sec cd, Super Armor, -15% Healing Recieved, 1000% x 40 (over the 20 seconds), and 80 pain damage per 2 for 20 seconds\n-- Tute (flute) as a whole needs some kind of protection, its far too easy to get interupted and locked down as a Shai. this applies for both PvE and PvP. Were forced to eat mob CC/damage since where stuck standing still and/or jump around trying to avoid it and breaking up mob groupings. In pvp, any random/stray CC finds its way to us. We cant even be in range to buff teammates without also being in CC range. I would suggest Frontal Guard on all Tute songs, so we can be protected from random CC but also cant just freely buff allies forever.\n-- Tute Rank 3 system needs a rework, this in concept is fine, but the choices put forward are not compelling and feel bad.---- Sun, Moon, Stars R3: Just feels like this should be the default for us as a Shai. I would suggest removing Sun, Moon, Stars from the rank3 system and having it be a choice between only the other 3.---- Shout to the Sky R3: I would make the Hot baseline for Rank2 and have Rank3 just increase the healing amount. This also doesnt scale at all, with my already 9-10k HP pool it feels very lackluster.-: Rank 2: +15% Max HP, +10% HP, +100 HP per 2 for 10 seconds [this is still about +700 max at \"normal hp\" levels, Valk puri is 20% heal on 8 sec cd.]-: Rank 3: +20% Max HP, +15% HP , +150 HP per 2 for 10 seconds [this is around +1200 max]---- Summer Rain R3: This skill has been made almost useless in PvP with the CC changes and only effective for some niche content as is.-: Rank 2: +30% All Resist, +5% DR Rate, +15DR-: Rank 3: +40% All Resist, +8% DR rate, + 20DR---- Time to Shine R3: The BSR is awesome, but is totally invisible the vast majority of the time.-: Rank 2: +3% BSR regen, +1 Hp on Attack, +100 MP per 5-: Rank 3: + 4% BSR regen, +2 Hp on Attack, +150 MP per 5This Change gives each one a solid role. 1 for healing, 1 for defense, 1 for offense\n-- Tuning is and has always been a useless skill, please rework it into something.\n-- Do it Better; animation needs a speed up. Its currently the only E buff in the game that can literally kill you to use.moving on to Pre-awakening:-- Surf is just poorly designed, the novelty has long worn off.Please make the start/stop significantly faster or give it Super Armor\n-- Come Out, Come Out: the CD is opressive for what it does. Its a Taunt skill, similar skills have a 15-20 sec CD. Not 2 minutes.I would suggest reducing the cooldown to 20 seconds\n-- Play Dead, 5 min cd for what is Nightmare/Nocture without the cool bonuses....I would suggest reducing cooldown to between 30-60 seconds\n-- Rabams other than Twirl Boom need a complete rework.---- Spirits AI is terrible, they die too easy, and have too much overlap/dont stack with similar effects. Would suggest making the effect (short) ranged projectiles and increasing the base HP/DP---- Tumble is just bad; no damage, protection doesnt even last the skill duration, does get the flow speed buff Twirl Boom does... I would just make this baseline, increase the FG duration and give use a new Rabam. We need the Pve bound of misc content anyways---- Careful doesnt heal enough, heal yourself, and has horrible Z axis issues. Doesnt heal anyone at all the majority of the time. I would make this more like Corsair's Mist Effects-:  +100 HP to self and allies per second while in area. lasts 10 seconds (20 sec CD)---- Now!; I would make this like Toxic Flood, but reveals/slows and some minor damage -:  700x20 (over the duration), reveals enemines, -10% all slow for 5 seconds. lasts 10 seconds (12 sec CD)\n-- Get Well needs % scaling and a buff, it just does not heal remotely enough. Alternately i would suggest reworking it to be a Super HoT as it meshes with the other parts of the kit\n-: +10% HP on ticks (max 3), +350 per 2 for 10 seconds --- cooldown lowered to 60 seconds\n-- Sprinkle Sparkle, has almost no relevance to the game. At the very least Id suggest making in a Mana over time and significantly stronger, if not entirely changing it.I would suggest a Slow/Dot cleanse with Super Armor on a low CD.\n\n--Gather Round; needs some love. It doesnt work against most mobs [even life mobs], doesnt do damage, and costs stamina? what even is this.\ndont really know how/should this should be fixed in context of other suggestions.\n-- Gathering/Alchemy passives need a rework. They suck. bad.\nideas: random Trace Drops on monster kills, increase elxir durations, increase chance of extra gathering loot, increased chance at more alchemy blue procs, +mastery, etc....Tuck and Roll + Hop, Skill buffs need their durations increased to 15 or 20 seconds. We have too much to keep up for these to have such short windows. Go Away needs its hotkey changed to S + F and probably should be a Bound or KD. Add Caphras Enhancement to Sol. We cant keep up in the brackets with other classes, making Talent damage even worse than it already is. Shai also as a whole needs another hard look at ability flow, certain skills get caught or interupted do to hit stagger (not even proper CC).PvP damage taken needs a look as well, most of us are fine with being a full support class, but being forced into seperate gear to not get blown up is unacceptable."

With gravedig nerf it cannot trade with certain classes (Musa, succ dracc, mae, etc) and is 100% reliant on grab. Grab is currently unprotected, a 14second CD & is heavily impacted by both yours and your oppenents ping to servers. If you play vs a musa or Mae with lower ping than you it is almost impossible to grab them if they are skilled as they can abuse the desync to \"teleport\" around your character. This and with the combination of warriors unprotected movement and lack of sustained movement the class has to be aggressive and is a risk/reward of if grab misses you lose and if it lands they lose, which is fun for no one.Suggestion: Warrior needs some sort of protected movement, needs some sort of protected ability to trade but we dont want it to be reliant solely on grab & Grave slow as protected slows (above 10%) should not exist in BDO.Reckless core if full charged: Allows warrior to have a procted CC or dmg that has a long charge time, making it so people can easily counter it with a grab or evade it if needed while giving warrior some sort of sustain and dmg.Remove core solar flare and make Super armor innate along with removing its CC. Solar flare is rarely used as a CC anyways and is currently our only protected disengage which is still VERY unreliable as it needs headchase to also be on cooldown. Solar flare innate SA allows for better mobility and allows warrior to take something else as core to help the kit.Headchase flow, add headchase flow as a secondary cooldown to headchase (similar to wizard Teleport Flow) but instead of iframe make it SA. Allows for warrior to move without it being broken as another iframe.Heavens cleave SA, flow out of solar flare thats insanely slow needs SA as it also deals low dmg in comparison to other skills other classes have that are SA.Keep gravedig slow at 10% but restore it to 10seconds, 10% slow is fairly neglible for most classes in uncapped PvP and only matters in AoS, in group fights you're still killing people but gives warrior only a slight edge.Add other affects to warcry, scars and other skills that give dp/dr buffs. As they've removed the stacking they're now useless as we always have Q block buff which overwrites these."

The level 2 & 3 of flame buster when you fire put you in an animation before firing the shot that is way to long in a meta with a lot of fast classes than can drop cc's in the locked animation.\nSolution:\n- Keep the system for q buff as it is. It's ok that the infinite knockdowns got removed. But currently our q buff feels really stale to use and way more useless to use overall, it's still unprotected even with high resists. Giving us our normal damage on a fast cast just like level 1 flame buster seems like a fair reward for positioning. I currently play with it on level 1 since atleast i can move around decently fast at the loss of a lot of damage.TLDR: Make is so that Titan syndrome enables Berserker to use a fast animation Flame buster on ALL levels and not just level 1.For the rest the class is fine. Thanks for years of joy!"

        "content": "Family Name: Uca\nRegion: EU\nClass: Awakening Mystic\nSuggestion: Improve pvp utility\n\nMystic\nMystic is a really interesting melee class. The class has amazing control around her. Her succession has amazing damage where her awakening is more about control and support. Personally I don't think awakening having strong damage for PvP is what Pearl Abyss envisions for the spec. I like that awakening is more supportive in PvP, being a tanky class with good control and with low damage. However I do think that her intended presence and pressure isn't living up to the expectations. These changes is what mystic needs to make the intention of Pearl Abyss a reality.\n\nChanges\nMystic awakening doesn't really have frontals. The proctection is mostly Super Armor. This is good to be able to soak damage while still being a threat. However I do think that she should get a skill with frontal guard in awakening. Since adding a new frontalguard would be a bit excessive, I was thinking about changing the Super Armor of Gushin Water to Frontal Guard. This would give her the ability to react to threats and incoming damage since Gushin Water is an amazing skill that flows off of other skills. This would also make the gameplay more fluid by giving awakening the chance to block damage rather than soaking it.\n\nAwakening Mystic's new skill called Raging Wind was introduced with the intent of pulling monsters better. I have yet to experience this \"intention\" with the new skill. The range is pretty cool but you don't pull monsters using Raging Wind. It's also not practical to use the skill in PvE to pull. This cool idea Pearl Abyss had, could be turned into something better for PvP. The skill has no damage which is totally fine. However adding a stiff on Raging Wind would make the skill usefull. Adding a Knockdown on Dragon Strike after Raging Wind would give awakening more utility to control the fight around her, better.\n\nConclusion\nRather than buffing her weakness (that is having low damage in PvP), Pearl Abyss should buff the good part of Awakening which is control and support.\n\nPS: I happen to have this feedback translated in Korean as well, because I made a koreanpost a couple of weeks ago. Link to the post."

Especially when you changed prime blind thrust from stun to stiff leaving decap the only stun in the succession kit which is used so much outside of any way to utilize it's stun. Request a passive change to match the needs of the class, such as 5-15% stamina cost reduction on chase would be a good balance.\n\nTo further help the stamina management of the kit since it cannot rotate forward guards reliably, whirlwind cut ought to regen stamina. It's only fair considering that musa fiery angel movement ability regens stamina which makes very little sense if all movement abilities are suppose to consume stamina. Whirlwind cut is not a movement skill but a trading skill or finisher. It deserves a stamina buff.\n\nPetal swirl being the old 15 secs cool down is extremely out of date compared to the awakening kit's petal swirl cool down. Match the cool down of the ability. \n\nAdditionally, maehwa has very little to combat grabs and trading and nothing compared to musa's fiery angel's utility. Sleet step iframe and sa on cd would be of great benefit to the awakening kit. Stigma on both kits would benefit greatly having initial iframe into SA on stab and give her the edge she needs to outplay grab classes."

        "content": "Family Name: VeltasRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: Spirit Satiation and Vedir's DogmaDetails:  \n  \nSpirit Satiation: the current skill at rank 3 recovers 30 HP per tick while we remain stationary & unprotected and channel the skill. I propose: drastically increase the HP recovery of the skill, but also apply a significant Minus DP debuff while we use it and for a short time after. The intent of this idea is to allow better HP recovery when out of combat, but the addition of a temporary DP debuff balances this better HP recovery by ensuring we cannot use Spirit Satiation during combat or immediately re-engage after using it. It provides so little HP on use in its current state, that Spirit Satiation is basically useless. If I am in a situation where I am using Spirit Satiation to recover HP, I would most likely be better off simply dying and respawning rather than trying to recover health with the skill as it currently is. So an improvement to the HP regen is very desirable. Again, I appreciate that having too easy an HP regen may be imbalanced and promote too reckless of play if it is too trivial to recover HP between reckless engagements. So that is why I recommend balancing the proposed immense HP regen with a temporary DP debuff or something similar so that it is useable but not abuseable.     \n   \nTL;DR - however you achieve balancing it, I just want Spirit Satiation to actually feel useful to me. If I'd rather die & respawn than stand somewhere pressing shift+space, why does this ability even exist?\n  \n  \n\nVedir's Dogma: I propose making Vedir's Dogma a more essential part of the Dark Knight class. Currently, Vedir's Dogma increases minor ability damage by 20%, at a negligible periodic MP cost. However, the abilities it improves are sseldom used, and the MP cost is so minor as to be negligible. The ability is currently not useful except for the interesting cosmetic effect applied to the kriegsmesser. I propose a dramatic change to how this ability works. \nThis will sound severe but bear with me. First, reduce all DK damage across the board for all abilities when Vedir's Dogma is not active. Second, rework Vedir's Dogma so that while using it, it increases ALL DK damage by an appropriate amount for ALL DK abilities. Thirdly, increase the resource costs of Vedir's Dogma so that it is not completely negligible. Basically, re-imagine Vedir's Dogma as an effect that a DK player wants to keep active, that they absolutely enjoy being in. Vedir's Dogma will be a state of being for a DK that the DK must manage to some degree. Using it will be critical, not using it will be suboptimal. Vedir's Dogma is not currently interesting. I don't care if you make it \"strong\" because DK does NOT need to be stronger, but I want this ability to actually matter to my play.   \n  \nTL;DR - The specifics of my proposal are unimportant, but the general idea is that I want Vedir's Dogma to actually make a difference and be something DKs actually use."

        "content": "Family Name: Armin\nRegion (NA/EU): NA & EU (NA Primarily)\nClass (Awakening/Succession):  Succession\nSuggestion: State of overall classes that require nerfs, and suggestions for nerfing Succession Ninja, based off my experience in PvP inside and outside of Arena of Solare.\nDetails: \n \nOver the past several months PA has continued with the trend of buffing more rather then nerfing. A good example of this was the most recent changes to Warrior, while no other classes received any tuning down based off Arena of Solare's overall rankings.\n \nCurrently after the recent buffs, alongside past strengths, there is 11 classes that are in need of nerfs. either minor or major (i'll be providing suggestions regarding these as well):\n \n- Awakening Musa\n- Succession Ninja\n- Succession Dark Knight\n- Awakening Sorceress\n- Succession Mystic\n- Awakening Striker\n- Succession Nova\n- Succession Hash\n- Succession Berserker\n- Awakening Valkyrie\n- Succesion Witch/Wizard\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAwakening Musa: Awakening Musa is currently the highest rated overall class in many regions due to one simple factor, its consistency. It's a class that has no real downfall outside of not having grab, due to having so much protection, movement, and damage. An easy solution to fixing this problem is not to remove its consistency, but reduce it so it's not as strong, keeping it consistent but not overly OP.\n \n- Change the Knockdown on Searing Slam (극도 가르기) to a Bound\n       > This adjustment will help in reducing its consistency as a major part of musa playstyle is currently playing fully SA and playing off of landing Searing Slam into a guaranteed kill. A 6 second cooldown SA KD engage is overall too strong, especially when the only means of punishing it is by grabbing it, which is a coin flip scenario as in the scenario you mistime it, you are 100% dead.\n \n- Remove the slow from Searing Slam(극도 가르기)\n        > Searing Slam having access to a slow makes it even more incredibly toxic as Musa already has access to an extremely strong slow in his skill \"One step back\" (역퇴참), a 50% movement speed slow that is SA and is part of their normal movement and engage rotation. Having access to 1 slow is already a big strength, especially when that slow is a 50% movement speed slow. Having access to 2 slows is even more incredibly toxic, especially when one of them is your engage CC skill.\n \n- Change Flow: Dash Slash(흐름 : 강격 ) to a float\n              > Similar to the logic behind Searing Slam, Awakening musa is currently one of the highest DPS classes in the game. His overall strength comes from his ability to confirm KD's, changing his KD skills to a float will overall reduce the damage it pumps out (which is ridiculous in many scenarios) and will still keep his strength in consistency as he still has access to a hard CC in most scenarios. While im not 100% sure about this change and am more confident about the previously 2 mentioned changes, I'd keep it in mind.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSuccession Ninja: Being my main class, I'm aware of what is the main issue with Succession Ninja, that being its E buff. Succession Ninja while having a strong kit overall, fortunately has the downside (that many other classes do not struggle with) being it has actual gaps and requires risk and reward in its kit. Unfortunately, this completely falls out the window once the ninja is E buffed. Succession Ninja's E buffs allows him to reduce his need of using unprotected damage skills, and simply focus on SA damage only, due to how much damage it provides. As a result:\n \n- Reduce the crit rate on Succession Ninja's E buff from 30% to 10%\n        > Succession Ninja has 0% Crit on many of its highest hitting abilities (Shadow stomp, Bladespin, etc). When combined with an E buff that gives crit after reboot, his damage levels rose too much during these skills to the point of nuking opponents. \n \n- Reduce the bleed value applied during the E buff from 120 -> 90\n           > Like many classes that have unique aspects to their E buff (Striker/Mystic) that give them special traits, Succession Ninja's is his dot values that apply. The weirdly balanced issue is that the E buff value that provides dots to his kit, is more than the base value. While in a normal scenario I'd have to drop 3 skills uniquely to get all 3 dots onto an opponent, with a value of 90/90/110 respectively for each dot. The E buff makes all 3 of these dots hit instantly for 120/120/120 (totaling 360 HP per 3 sec), which is more than the base value of 90/90/110. Dropping the E buff dot value to this will feel his damage feel more normal during the E buff, but simply making it easier to apply, rather than making it much stronger for no apparent reason.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSuccession Dark Knight: After the most recent buffs Succession Dark Knight was frankly Overtuned. I'm not sure what the reason was for giving it so many increases in kit, without realizing the impact it had on the rest of the kit. It has reached sorceress/kunoichi levels of i-frame and mobility, with access to KD's on top which Succession Kunoichi never had, and damage levels that Sorc has never had access to either. Addressing some of the new toys it's received would be the easiest solution, as a class that once was difficult to play with a high skill ceiling, has turned into something anyone can play and get massive effectivesness with little to no thought going into their gameplay, as its's so difficult to punish.\n \n- Remove the SA from Prime: Air Strike and instead remove it's ability to have collision\n        > Air strike since DK's birth has always been an unprotected engage that took finess to use, now it's the complete opposite, a skill with no thought put into it's use that can simply be tossed with no repercussions. It's bolstered her movements in mid fight, and has taken her from a in-fight specialist with good enough mobility to keep up and move around, to a demon that can continuously keep pressure on opponents with no real counterplay. The skill having collision was the MAIN issue previously, as in many scenario it wasn't able to be used as a risky, but potentially worthwhile disengage. Remove the SA, take away the collision, and it will have more options to be used as a risky disengage (that takes finess) while also letting it be a punishable gap for DK's that want to play aggressive with it. \n \n- Remove the ability to instantly Kamasylvia Slash out of Twilight Dash\n        > Players complained about Tendon Cutter and it received a nerf, this ability is LITERALLY Tendon Cutter, except in Kunoichi's case where it was a Float, this one is a KD with massive burst damage attached, and absolutely 0 stamina cost. On top of that, the cooldown is funny enough the exact samge cooldown as Tendon Cutter as well. Here's a clip even showing the range on Twilight Dash -> Kama slash being absolutely ridiculous: https://clips.twitch.tv/PoliteSnappyDuckKappaWealth-FtBpcbi29TWmnoBc  . Before the idea comes up that \"oh you could already do this previously before the buffs\". Yes, this was able to be used in combination before the buffs, but the difference was previously it actually used up one of your best I-frame cooldowns as a result. This chain now has no repercussions, little room to punish, and absolutely no thought required on it from the DK's side. Extremely toxic ability, that is all I really need to say.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nAwakening Sorceress: Despite having one of the best open world kits in the game, riddled with I-frame spam, little to no issues staying in the middle of a ball, and a plethra of slows and SA CC's to spam out, Awakening Sorceress is not necessarily an S tier class when it comes to AoS. Regardless of this, there are issues that are too strong on the class, and ways of solving her issues in AOS that make her an overall healthier kit in all aspects.\n \n- Remove the SA CC from Shadow Eruption \n           > A completely unneccsary addition to Awakening Sorceress during the reboots that has made it incredibly hard to balance the class in an overall aspect. Due to having access to an SA CC like this, it's hard to buff her in other terms, since her protected CC spam is too strong. Removing this gives more room to make adjustments in other aspects, that will bring her more in line.\n \n- Reduce the AoE of Imminent Doom, keep the current AoE of Dream of Doom\n            > Imminent doom has realistically always had too big of an AoE, but rather than solving the issue during reboots, the animation size was increased to match the realistic AoE of the ability. Even pre-reboot, this skill has always been a no-risk, big reward type of ability, due to being extremely hard to catch in many scenarios. Removing this takes away some of her CC option, as said before, while also opening room for other buffs in different areas.\n \n- Change the Super Armor on Flow: Soul Reaper to Frontal guard, remove the down smash, and increase base hits from 1380% x2, max 2 hits to 1380% x3, max 3 hits\n           > Changing this ability to a frontal guard, gives it a more risk/reward esque ability, especially since the ability has minor movement to it, meaning good positioning is required. I also think its a bit strange sorc has access to multiple down smashes, that at times can not only help but also destroy combos, when forcing a KD too early, or allowing for down smash resets, which personally I think is a stupid mechanic. In return for removing a key super armor in her kit, offering more damage for her to play around in combos will give her an easier time against opponents, once providing a CC.\n \n- Remove the SA when entering Nightmare\n           > Nightmare has become a basically unpunishable ability, both with its utility to survive, and it's new connections that allow her to flow in and out of it very smoothly. After super armor was added to the start, outplay potential when a sorc uses this ability carelessly, practically does not exist. Despite having no stamina recovery inside the ability, the ability to reset cooldowns completely is already an extremely valuable tool, on top of her the ability to use it as a blockjump with the exit knockback attached. \n \n- Add a -10 DP buff to Flow: Soul Reaper \n          > Sorc has issues getting a consistent -DP Debuff out in group fight scenarios, this is a large issue of why her damage struggles in some scenarios, since her -DP buffs are tied to pure unprotected abilities that cannot often proc easily. Adding a MINOR -DP to soul reaper, will alleviate this issue, while not massively bolstering her damage. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------This post will be continued on a later page, please reference and move on to look at that one for an extension."

It was a great change. Prior to its release, the maximum height at which it could be cast was greatly reduced, as it should have been to avoid dive bombing from a mountain. However, I believe that it was reduced to the point that the the maximum height became too low, thus vastly limiting it's utility.\n\nAs such, a bug  surfaced where if you tried to link it from Prime: Furious Chase or dash forward linking from Prime: Primrose Sprint on uneven terrain, she sometimes would cast the skill stationary instead of dashing forward.\nThus, I suggest that the maximum height of casting Prime: Salpuri Purge be increased slightly to prevent reouccurances of the bug and to increase its utility."

Class modifiers butcher any damage awakening wizard would like to deal, all the while making him take significantly more damage from others. The combination of Protected CC and Protected Damage on succession skills across the board (and even on certain awakenings; wizard included) do not allow for Wizard to do what he would LIKE to do with his kit; be a pseudo-melee close-medium ranged caster, applying large AOE damage and debuffs. There are alot of classes that can achieve this fantasy to a significantly better degree, and while they do not have the support skills that wizard does, I do not believe that those support skills mean that awakening wizard should suffer where succession ironically does not. My Suggestions would be as follows: Pre-Awakening / Staff Kit Changes: \n\nAcross the board,  increase the damage of Absolute staff skills in awakening to be uniform with the Rank III Variants of the skills. If you look at certain skills (Fireball Explosion, Lightning Storm, Residual Lightning, Meteor,) These skills all have PVP Damage reduction on their Absolute variants, but do NOT have PVP Damage reduction on their Absolute variants. For Instance: \nBecause of this, the Absolute versions actually end up dealing LESS damage in PVP than the non-absolute variants. This makes no sense. Why would I put skill points into these only for them to do less damage? The damage the non-absolutes are dealing is the damage the Absolutes SHOULD be dealing. \n\nConcentrated Magical Arrow: This skill needs a complete functional rework in its entirety. There is no reason to use this skill almost ever. There are more use cases for dagger stab than there are this. I suggest: -Remove the casting bar, it has no reason to be there. \n-Add a forward guard\n-Add five more hits to the skill\n-Remove the stiffness in PVP\n-Increase cooldown to five seconds\nWith these changes, this would be significantly more useful of a skill; it would be a protected awakening > staff swap, would deal relevant damage in PVE, and would be significantly faster. People would stop permanently locking this skill and actually use it.\nFireball Explosion: Increase the PVE damage of this skill, and increase its casting speed motion after Sage's Rage. The Logical flow of Sage's Rage > Fireball Explosion is cool, but it feels a tad too slow, please make the animation speed 20% faster, as well as bumping the PVE damage by perhaps 200% damage per hit. (1192x5 > 1392x5) Lightning Chain: Increase the lightning storm sustaining buff duration to 15 seconds. Lightning Storm: Add a BRIEF forward guard to this skill, and allow it to be used from awakening stance while the Sustaining buff is active. \n\nEarthquake: Reduce the cooldown of this skill to 15 seconds.\n\nEarth's Response: Add a super armor to this, with a very brief linger.\n\nMagical Shield:\nThis is important; Increase Magical Shield's duration to be 50 seconds, with a 10 second down time\nOR \nReduce the cooldown to 40 seconds to allow for a similar 10 second down time.\n\nAnd finally, the pipe dream: Give Awakening wizard split teleport. Seriously. This will likely never happen, because that's supposed to be succession wizard's strength, but awakening wizard has so little counterplay to someone just rushing you down and grabbing you that NOT having an alternative motion but Teleport or Elementalization (Similarly punishing cooldowns) leave Wizard with very little to no options. I do not believe succession should get anything in return for awakening also having this, as succession benefits from instant cast after teleport already; Awakening doesn't have any of that function. (Awakening witch should also get this but this isn't a post about witch)\n\nAwakening Changes: \n\nOnto awakening. I only have a few changes I would like in this regard, but I feel they would be impactful. First of all, Summons need to do more. As Whyso pointed out, and as the more test-savvy people have found, Summon damage does not appear to be effected by special attack modifiers. This should be fixed immediately. In particular to awakening wizard summons, I suggest:While Arne is summoned: --Water Sphere\n-Add two more hits to Water sphere's damage\n-Grant water sphere 25% crit chance\n\nWhile Marg is summoned: --Hellfire\n-add two more hits to Hellfire's summon damage\n-Add all ap +10 on hellfire cast while Marg is summoned\n\nFor Elementalizaiton, I suggest:\n-Reduce the cooldown to 10 seconds\n-Allow it to be used via its own input (S+Space) From staff\n-Allow its quick cast to be used after Black Spirit Rage Hellfire, Cataclysm, and Water Sphere\n\nAbout black spirit rage skills, there are a few bugs;\nBSR Hellfire does not flow properly into magma bomb (W+F+RMB > RMB does not work; magma bomb is not cast.)\nBSR Cataclysm's AOE increase doesn't seem to be working while Marg is summoned; Marg also decreases the AOE of cataclysm to begin with.\n\nFor Chilling Wave, I suggest: -Move the crit chance buff to Flame's Calling, and increase the buff effect to 20% crit chance, and increase the duration to 15 seconds.\n-Increase forward guard strength\n\nFor Flame Knot: I suggestLiterally anything. This is probably the singular worst grab in the game, both for what kit it's in (incredibly low mobility) and the grab itself.\nAwakening wizard doesn't have very many down smashes, it has exactly two; one of them isn't exactly ideal to use because it pushes the target away from us, and the other is an AOE bound which sometimes messes up CC counters, and is unprotected (not that down smashes should be protected; but that's the standard as of late it seems) Make the grab a knockdown, or give it some ignore grapple resist, SOMETHING, ANYTHING to make this grab actually useful aside from when I get an opportunity to use it once in a century. Please. Thank you for coming to my ted talk, I will continue to grief my teammates in AoS on awakening wizard until it gets buffed. Thanks."

Danse Macabre was updated to use stamina (which is fair and is used to cancel out of Chain Crash), BUT Chain Crash was never adjusted for with the Stamina cost change to Danse.

        "content": "Family Name: Nerdelen\nRegion: EU\nClass: Dark Knight (both specs)\nSuggestion: Useless skills and self buffs\n\nCurrently, DK lacks self buffs, compared to other classes. We only get a minor attack speed buff from unveiled dagger, which lasts 5 seconds. At the same time, there are many useless skills in the dk kit that dont offer anything at all, namely: Vedir's Dogma, Imperious Command, and Spirit Satiation. My suggestions regarding these skills would be:\n\nFirst of all, make Vedir's dogma and spirit satiation usable at both succession and awakening specs. This is totally possible since spirit satiation uses a unique key input (shift+space) and vedir's dogma is a quickslot skill.\n\nRegarding Spirit Satiation: This skill should be a meaningful healing skill. Instead of healing continuously but for a small amount, it should heal a decent amount of HP and MP instantly (maybe 1000/500 respectively), while having a 20 or 30 seconds cooldown. This would help particularly with mana management, which seems to be a big issue for dks who dont have the mp infinity pot, and even more so for awakening dk players.\n\nRegarding Vedir's Dogma: As mentioned, dk lacks self buffs. It could be reworked into a passive skill, with a meter similar to Nova's Engarde. The meter fills by using regular dk skills, and provides a buff (maybe +20AP and + 10% attack speed for a few seconds) when used by quickslot. The meter should fill by either succ or awak skills, so the new Vedir's dogma will be usable in both specs."

        "content": "Family Name: TrodzeyRegion: NAClass: ArcherSuggestion: Archer PvE and PvP Improvement IdeasDetails: \n -- Mainhand: The kicks are completely useless. Even in PvP, no one uses them because we have better and less risky options to CC. The damage ranges from 700-860x3. You really can't do anything with that. I suggest they are removed and all of those flows are given to skills that are actually used because besides that, we do not have many flows. Not having flows means you have to press a lot of buttons in order to grind efficiently, which can be exhausting for some.  For example I think Earth shatter (hold an input) > storm of light (no windup) > wrath of nature (no windup) would be a nice flow. The order could be different, but I think those 3 go well together in a flow. Storm of light could use some changes first though. You can't use it much right now because 2 enemies can block the entire group from taking damage. It should have a bigger radius like arrow explosion does. If the kicks are gone, that will free up the F key (PC) for a sunfall > arrow explosion flow. If the kicks are left in that would still be a nice flow.  Lastly, it would be nice if Verdure clout had more range. The issue is, if you meteor dive over someone, then verdure clout to follow up CC, sometimes you are out of range (even though you are in melee range) due to high movement speed from the passive + glide.\n\n--Awakening: If we could (flow) full bloom > marked bloom or vice versa, that would be very nice. Spear of sylvia is a risky skill to use, even in PvE, because you stand still in melee range. It should do 1520 x 10 instead. Righteous smite has 8 skills that flow into it, but the cooldown is 20 seconds. I suggest the cooldown be 15 seconds or the skills flow into other skills. Righteous fire should apply all effects in PvP.  Glissade should give 22 ap and the 10 ap buff should be removed from lights path/greatbow training. This way we can naturally pre buff with ensnare and glissade. Before reboot, the awakening Zephyr leap went the same distance as mainhand zephyr leap. Now awakening is shorter. I don't know if that was intended because it was never mentioned in the notes but hopefully that can be fixed. The elvia skill (resenting arrow) can sometimes just hit the floor again and again if your archer is too short. Righteous smite as well. I don't know if this ever effects other classes, but I would hope character customization doesn't effect combat.\n\n--PvP: I'm mainly speaking about AoS here because archer is in an okay spot in other pvp situations. I'm not really sure what should be done about this because it is the 'class fantasy', but archer is too squishy or too easy to kill in AoS.  Any class can chase you and stop most of your damage if they want to, because archer is too squishy to trade with anyone. Some classes can kill you by themselves. Some classes can kill you without any E buff and without CCing you.  We don't do more damage than other classes, and you can see the results of that in the AoS rankings. Archers are having a hard time even getting into top 100. It isn't that complicated but I am assuming that it won't change either. If we are going to continue to be so easy to kill, I suggest adding vortex to sunfall, or adding a new skill that will give us some relief while being chased. I don't think grab would solve this / I don't think it should either., but when a musa runs at us I don't want to continue the feeling of \"there's nothing I can do\".  There has to be some counterplay for archers. \n\nFor the record, I have tried building full evasion 210/210/360 + evasion + dp - accuracy addons. You don't live much longer unless only 1 person is after you, and you are missing out on ~60% of your damage. It would be hard to die on another class with the same build. \n\n--Elavation: On reboot you guys gave almost everything I asked for except this. We still have the issue that half of our skills unable to attack someone above us or below us. That's all. Thank you for your time and for looking after the class."

        "content": "Family Name: HasieRegion: NAClass: Ranger (Succession)Suggestion: Feedback for recent changes to Succession RangerDetails: Recently there was a change to Prime: Ultimate: Blasting Gust, changed from Super Armor to Frontal Guard. According to the devs, the change was made so the skill has better capability in high end PvE. \nHowever, changing it to Frontal Guard made the skill redundant, same function as Prime: Razor Wind, Prime: Extreme Charging Wind (shotgun). The developers noted a contradiction that Prime: Ultimate: Blasting Gust is Ranger's signature skill, but now there is nothing better or special about the skill as it is low dps, stationary Frontal Guard skill.\n\nThe change affects ranger PvP in terms of Arena of Solare, (not so much in open world). With many classes with 'go behind the enemy's back' skills (i.e Sorc Nightmare, DK's Nocturne, Ninja/Kuno Blockjump, Hash Arid Assault) that are popular in Arena of Solare, changing Prime: Ultimate: Blasting Gust to Frontal Guard is rather a significant nerf. In fact, no one has asked for this change and only thing I've heard so far from both NA and KR players are negative about this change. Please revert the Super Armor back to the skill.\nAnd if you are going to say it's a class signature skill, please make it so it lives up to the name."

        "content": "Family Name: EirRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Maewha Sucession Suggestion: Needs an overall upgrade\nDetails:\nI have commented on the subject before, but since a thread is opened to talk about ir, I expose my ideas and opinions as a Maewha otp ( ''One Tirck Pony'') player from many years. \nI would like to make several points about why the maewha urgently needs a big buff, not only because she is one of the worst characters for both pvp and pve, but because there are characters that are absurdly broken right now, such as berseker, striker, sorcerer...\n\n- To begin with, we start from the basis that the character can hardly stand anything, he dies immediately like many others, but unlike the others, he does not have the resources to be able to defend himself or attack. He barely has supermor abilities, he only has 1 invincible which is temporary on the first dash or ''Chase'' every x time and getting into combat to deal damage is practically impossible, he only has some of his frontal guards attacks and most of his abilities to start combos or catch enemies have nothing and are not protected in any way.\nNot even breaking through for a surprise attack usually works out, also one of the best options he had previously was his arrows. But they were nerfed for no logical reason. It's true that Awakening has received some significant improvements and is a bit better, but the Sucession at the moment is completely out of date and unplayable.\n\n- Another important point is the issue of breath, the maewha spends 5 breath points for each dash and her attacks also spend breath. If you do the dash canceling the ability you spend 10 breath points and on top of that the game design sometimes pushes you back spending breath and energy anyway. You advance 80 meters on the map spending 100% of your breath.  The maewha does not have energy problems, it recovers more than it spends but it does recover breath, and even having breath at level 35+ I stay at 0 in nothing when other characters like berseker as an example his breath does not drop below 80 never moving 10 times more that the maewha, jumping from one side to another, or for example the valkyrie that does exactly the same and doesn't waste breath either...\n\nfor example:\nDragon bite consumes 8 breath points.Carver consumes 6.Decapitation consumes 4 or 5, I don't understand why sometimes it consumes more or less, it is something that should appear in the skills section but only the energy it consumes appears but not the breath of any.Whirlwind cut consumes 11 breath points.\n\nThis is a character that focuses on combos, good attack with low defenses and good mobility, this is how he has always tried to sell himself but now he has no combo chances and mobility compared to many other characters.\nI think it would be a good option to eliminate or significantly change the breath function since there are characters that do not spend or spend little and others who spend too much, it feels very heavy and frustrating even when grinding, one has to spend half an hour walking to recover the character's breath between pulls and pulls because he spends too much and right now the character doesn't even have his only tool which was mobility, he only has decent damage left that he can't take advantage of because he has no way to hit safely and no way to move anymore faster than other classes...\nIt is literally impossible to catch a berserker, a valkyrie, a nova... playing maewha. So the character has no mobility, hardly any protections, no grabs and average decent damage that many others far exceed, as well as having greater stamina, defenses and many other tools to be played better.\n\nPossible solutions to improve it in both pvp and pve:\n- Add a grab to the class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Remove or modify breath from various Skills\n- Substitute many or several frontal guard skills for supermor to be able to safely start the fights.\n- Put back Stub Arrow as it was before, now it's a useless tool\n- Fix the designs that are caused in the game when using dash\n\nI hope you take into account all this that I tell you as a veteran player of this class and help you to improve. All the best."

While the rest sits at around 200. But the better solution would be to simply add Stamina regen to skills like Sun Shielder (Shift Q) or Storm Surge (W+Rmb)There are enough skills that require her to use stamina (and all of them block the regen during it). No reason for non consuming skills to do so aswell. And to make the matter worse There are multiple bugs that Involve her terrible Stamina and ill come to that in a sec.So as for her Bugs and GapsShe has quiet a lot of bugs. Some are borderline breaking the class. To name a Few easily recreatable ones: - Using Jet Stream after any Stamina consuming skill. will completely block the regen of Stamina. - Using Skedadle during the awakening version of Smooth Sailing. doubles the cost of the skill. so instead of 200 it will cost 400 to use it. - Sea Stroll cannot be used in the air when using Wipe Out If you have used skills before it. If you use it without any skills it works perfectly fine. Spiral Soak works just fine if used either way. - You cannot use Pirates Life for me (F) When at 0 Stamina. even tho the skill does not require any. - It is possible to pocket the Anchor (again). Simply use Skedadle before the Anchor goes off. as long as you stay in pre awakening you can keep it indefinitely By using Wave Breaker you can let go of it and technically shoot out a second Anchor right after. There are plenty more and id gladly list em all up with how to recreate them. To mention one more ''bug/gap'' that shouldnt exist:You can get cc'd out of every mermaid skill. it can be during almost every part of the skill. This happens the most during Spiral Soak. after the Iframe part. But its possible to get cc'd straight out of the 100% Sea stroll during the long SA part. so it cant even be desync after the iframe. This especially affects Succession as they heavily rely on these skills. and die a lot of times just because of it. I think one guy alone made enough proof that this is a serious issue. and has been reporting this issue ever since it became one."

        "content": "Family Name: TadRegion: NAClass: Drakania (Awakening)Suggestion: Class Identity ImprovementsDetails: The current playstyle of awakened drak feels like it is trying to be too many things. It feels like its trying to be a fast class with the dragonflight & Hexeblood skills, as well as a slower juggernaut style class with the slower and harder hitting moves from the dragonblood skills. It feels like in order to get the benefits of both of these styles, the class abandons almost all of its pre-awakening kit and skills by making them feel bad to use over the awakening skills. I believe there are a couple of routes you could go that would benefit the class:1. Improve the absolute versions of the pre-awakening skills while also adding more fluid transitions from awakening -> pre-awakening so that it is more appealing to the players to swap between the two kits.2. Go all in on abandoning the pre-awakening kit and make no changes to the absolute versions of the skills, while improving the awakening side. Suggestions for doing so would be:a. Giving the class an additional protected movement skill as you are unable to fully chain protected movements while fighting.b. Giving the Q-Block SA so that the class can have a protected way to get back stamina, and wait for cooldowns on some of the longer CD skills. Will give the class a style of fighting similar to the other SA block classes.c. Add Core-versions of the skills in Dragonblood so players can lean towards either hexeblood or dragonblood while fighting. 3. One of the biggest gripes I have with the class is the PvP implementation of Dragonblood Sundering Roar. Although they are different skills, Dragonblood Sundering Roar reminds me the most of Awakened Sorcs Cartians Nightmare. However similar they are, they are not similar in their usefulness in PvP. Dragonblood Sundering Roar does 53.71% less damage in PvP, it also does not have SA, but instead FG, and it cannot be moved after casting. Although the skill is very good in PvE, it is very lackluster in PvP for being \"The\" showcase skill of the class/kit. 4. There are some QoL things that would be nice to have:a. Not getting the falling animation when using Doombringer off of a building roof.b. Being able to use Dragonflight mid Doombringer cast (while in the air)."

S Blocking while waiting for stamina to recover is generally not a good idea for Sage as many classes can quickly and easily slip behind forward guards. While Sage can use Lightning Prison and Rift Storm to gain a small amount of stamina while remaining protected, it just isn't worth doing since Sage cannot super armor trade well with most classes and will almost always be punished for remaining in stationary super armor for long periods of time. With the lack of opportunities to recover stamina due to the fast pace nature of BDO's combat, awakened sage is usually a sitting duck after all of his stamina has been burned through and there is no way to remain in the fight until his stamina recovers.\n\nBolt\n-Remove the 250 stamina consumption penalty when Bolt is on cooldown so that every Bolt consumes the normal 200 stamina.\n\nDivine Executioner\n-Remove stamina lock and allow sage to regenerate stamina during the skill's animation."

I know you wanted a viable follow up for Succession: Binding Spirals, but Purge is not the way for this. The range is too large for this skill -- especially with how short of a cooldown it has. Consider making binding spirals a stun instead and making the Purge cc range similar to Prime: Slanted Balance on Succession Dark Knight. This will make it so you aren't accidently ccing 5 people you aren't aiming at while forcing the hash to blow more important movement skills to follow up on a long ranged cc from Binding Spirals. Sure, you can't make a great combo off of it but if its on capped, you put a good amount of pressure on them. If it's uncapped, it doesn't matter ppl die from every other class in a single cc anyways. Piercing Tornado: this skill is too good now. It isn't something a lot of people talk about but it is too much imo. Its essentially a protected multi-hit cc with movement and decent damage. At least make it hit only once (at the end). It doesn't need to be a multi-hit cc that ignores Frontal Guard skills. To compensate for this, allow stamina regen when using this skill or make the skill use MP instead of stamina. Speaking of Frontal Guards, remove cc on Arid Assault and give it full Super Armor while you move/land when Succession: Hourglass of Defiance is not on cooldown (25s cd). Not really a fun skill for people who don't know how this class operates and its not really all that usable at the high end of pvp because it has major desync and you end up getting CCd the majority of the time from the place you used the ability, so you end up landing next to your target on the ground despite having Succession: Hourglass of Defiance Super Armor in effect. \n\nEvery other class can move fine with their movement skills with a simple shift + a/d but in Hash's case, it has an awful windup to it and you aren't even protected. Just remove this - it is uneccessary. \nThese changes will remove the toxicity from hash but make him even more fun to play. Not neccessary: I would also like to change how Succession: Chosen Blade works. You have a clear risk-reward when channeling the whole skill for the Knockdown which is completely fine, however, some people just want the Tornado from it. Consider moving the tornado summon slightly before the Super Armor is lost instead of slightly before the Knockdown effect is applied. Overall very small gap in time difference but you get to keep a clear risk-reward for CC.Allow Tail Cutter to be used from the hotbar."

It's been such a long lasting and consistent issue that it now just feels like playing around these bugs are just part of the class. But it is incredibly frustrating to deal with in PvE and even more so in PvP where it often leads to you getting ripped out of your skill and being frozen in dangerous situations. This bug occurs when your shard count changes either to or from 30 just before you initiate a skill that uses shards to change its effect. Although this occurs in many different situations depending on the conditions, the most common situations this happens with is when using crouching wolf after Spiral Torpedo or Gushing Waters, or using Wave Orb after Elbow Edge, Adamantine or Perfect Blow.This was a bug that affected Succession Mystic a lot in the past until it was eventually fixed, however with the Class Reboot, none of these issues were fixed for Awakening and there were also new issues (Specifically with Wave Orb) that were introduced but never addressed. It appears that some of these issues could be resolved by adjusting the timing of when the shard count is checked during the animation of the skill so theres more allowance for the delay in shard interaction. Alternatively, if that is not an option, at least adjust the logic of the skills to make it so they don't stun you for generating full shards as you're in the middle of the skill. Just let the skill activate as the non-sharded version. It's stupid that you get punished for trying to play the class as it was intended comboing shard generators into shard spenders.Also, there's another relatively minor bug that has been around forever but is still annoying when you do it out of habit. Using Tranquility during the spawn invulnerability window during Node/Conquest War doesn't generate and Martial Spirit Shards. Given the skill is a 40 second CD and you're often trying to give yourself full shards before you enter a fight, this can be very annoying to deal with and I'm sure many would be happy to see it finally fixed.Give Awakened Mystic the Reboot she deserves."

        "content": "Family Name: TravestyRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening Mystic Suggestions: PvP Buffs (PvE is fine)\nDetails: Since \"Reworks\" my motto is Awakening Mystic is dead. It is plagued by a plethora of bugs, gaps, and is fundamentally flawed. I will be focusing on skills instead of bugs since they have been mentioned earlier by Nezor (EU) & Daymo (NA). \n\n- Absolute Scissor Kick, SA at the end of skill was removed after \"Rework\" - please revert and return this to the kit.\n- Seaburial, damage modifiers in PvP are too high and skill is bugged with Shards. In addition please allow some jump height so that we don't get falling animation off a 1-foot incline. \n- Spiral Torpedo, compared to our Striker counterpart, has large gap at the end of cast that can only be closed with Gushing Waters which also has a gap at the end. Additionally, the skill will bug out if trying to transition from a higher plane to lower plane. Please allow some jump height on skill so we can traverse terrain without falling animation or \"Please Try Again bug\" which is a self-inflicted CC.\n- Crouching Wolf Flow, compared to our Striker counterpart, the attack speed effect is 10 seconds less. In addition, our cooldown does not align with crouching wolf itself which leads to unnecessary consumption of shards.\n- Dragonize (Ebuff),  compared to our Succ Mystic/Striker/Awa Striker counterparts, the Ebuff is lacking considerably. Change the AP buff to be +Melee AP so it stacks with our Spiral Torpedo +16 AP buff. Awakening Striker was given a 15% evasion buff on their Ebuff while Awakening Mystic was given 20 AP that does not stack with Spiral Torpedo, effectively only realizing 4 AP.  Potentially change the AP buff from Dragonize to something more relevant like Critical Damage, Accuracy, Evasion, or Heal.\n- Dragon's Rip (Vacuum), 30% slow was removed after \"Rework\", please revert this change. As it stands now, it is the weakest vacuum in the game and unlike Nova Vacuum you are animation locked and unable to move when casting. It was also the only protected slow Awakening Mystic had.\n- Raging Wind (New Skill from \"Rework\"),this skill is never used in PvP. A good change to this skill would either be to make it protected and castable without flows or to add CC such as a stiff or stun. Otherwise, the long 13 second cooldown plus the requirement to use unprotected skills into an unprotected flow makes it not worth the risk as it adds nothing. \n- Earth Splitter (New Skill from \"Rework\"), this skill is unprotected but can be used in 1v1 combos to DS reset a person at the very end. Instead of having downsmash/bound, remove all CC on this skill and add SA. Additionally, reduce the high 68% PvP damage modifier. \n- Absolute Hidden Claw, Extend I-frame on backstep of skill to match Succession Mystic Prime: Hidden Claw. \n- Infinite Fortitude, An outdated skill in a game with high levels of heals, damage, and slows. Instead of sitting there like an idiot for 5 seconds, why not add some utility to it such as heals (to you and whoever is near you). Additionally, upon original implementation idea, they stated that one could cancel skill and still have a lingering effect. Bring that back instead of its current form where you must be grabbed out of it in order to linger effect.\n- Flash Step (New Skill from \"Rework\"), Technically not a new skill but a copy of succession mystics Flash Step ability, this skill forces you into an awakening stance after 2 consecutive dashes. In contrast to Succesion Mystics flash step, this skill does not allow you to backwards dash consecutively. Two fixes for this skill would be to keep whichever stance you initially dash in the same and to allow backwards movement to flow consecutively like succesion mystic. \n\nOverall, hope this feedback reaches anyone. I mean anyone."

A significant portion of the awakened abilities either consume stamina and lock stamina recovery or just lock stamina recovery. Reducing the stamina cost on some of these abilities would help or allowing stamina recovery on Divine Executioner would go a long way as well. It's a 17 second cooldown and would give you a slight window to recover some stamina.Impaling Flash recently had been reworked and during the rework the range was reduced. This change made the return to location mechanic that was added to the ability seem redundant. You have to be so close to a target now to use it that returning to the starting position usually puts you in a vulnerable position. Rift Storm's AOE size is rediculously small when compared to other classes with similar abilities occupying the Shift-LMB key press. This is one of our main abilities to trade damage and the size is so small that people can move out of it with 0 effort. This wouldn't as large of an issue if the damage across the ability was more evenly distributed but because the damage is back loaded nearly every class in the game can easily finish their ability and step out of it.\n\nDuring class changes Shock Relay lost its forward guard when used off cooldown. Properly managing this cooldown was a great way to showcase your ability to play the class. Removing it entirely is questionable and I feel should be reconsidered. Sage Arkanon's currently do minimal damage in PVP despite being attached to a large portion of out abilities. These abilities also state that they have 50% accuracy but it's been tested and shown that this 50% accuracy applies only to PVE. Other classes with similar 'PET' abilities also suffer from this. Either the (PVE) suffix needs to be added to the tooltip to make this clear that it's intended or the abilities need to be fixed to have the accuracy in PVP.Most awakened classes that I have played in Black Desert have a wide variety of tools available to them through their mainhand skill kit. Recently some changes were made that improved the usability of some of the mainhand but more work needs to be done. A significant amount of abilities in the mainhand are unprotected or partially protected. This makes sense when you consider succession sage because they have a 1 second super armor buff applied when using rift chain off cooldown. This allows these abilities to be occasionally used and partially protected. But awakened doesn't get that 1 second super armor when using rift chain. This makes a significant amount of the mainhand feel nearly unusable for awakening. I believe adding this 1 second super armor to Absolute: Rift Chain would allow the mainhand to feel significantly more useful for the awakened kit. Prime: Rift Chain would maintain it's uniqueness by still allowing the ability to be used off cooldown. SuccessionSuccession Sage recently got a good amount of buffs that helped it a lot. A few more I'd love to see added to the list are:Currently succession sage has difficulty keeping up with long distance moving while out of combat. I propose Prime: Rift Chain giving the user a 10 second movement speed buff. The only ability in the succession sage kit that benefits from movement speed buffs is form shift which is not used for movement. Rift chain itself is not affected by movement speed buffs or slows so the movement of this ability would be unchanged. This buff would only allow the sage to do the normal walk faster to keep up with his team when crossing large distances out of combat.Illusion Compression is a fantastic way to try to catch a target but is extremely punishing to attempt because of the long two part animation. Being able to cancel out of the second part of the animation with rift chain would help succession sages 1v1 capabilities significantly (An area where it struggles the most)Atomagia as it's currently designed leaves a lot to be desired for a 40 second cooldown ability. The damage is insignificant due to the way it's distributed. It's extremely telegraphed since it can only be used after another long animation. This skill should redesigned to be more useful. Absolute : Ator's Thorn  is another ability that looks good on paper and has decent cancels but unfortunetly is unusable due to the stamina cost. Because of this almost every sage has this ability locked. I feel that removing the stamina cost on this ability and giving it a 7 second cooldown so that its not spammable anymore would make this a usuable ability.Succession sage is quite telegraphed. A few of the core abilities are two part abilities. If you rift chain after charging the ability, you are forced to finish the cast immediately upon leaving rift chain. Being able to cancel the ability while in rift chain would improve the ability to be unpredictable. Rift chain also seems like an ability that's designed to make the class more unpredictable due to its near invisible nature. Once people you encounter learn that all they need to do is watch the minimap to see the general direction the sage is moving it becomes nearly impossible to be unpredictable. Removing sage from the minimap during rift chain would be a significant improvement."

The issue is having a single barely protected skill to generate scant amounts of ions without being cc'd is just bad design and often leaves a drakania with no ions at all. It'd be smarter to distribute small amounts of ions across the less popular skills in addition to the Brimbolt Raze spam to encourage comboing with them. for example:\nMarkthanan's Dominion - 1 ion on hit\nMarkthanan's Breath - 1 ion on hit\nDragon's Maw - 2 ions on activation\nSoaring Assault - 1 ion on hit\nEmbers - 1 ion on activation\nThe numbers and skills could and should be changed around as needed to keep ions necessarily scarce but not totally unavailable to a Drakania who's smart with what skills she uses and where she uses them- this is just an example. To accomidate this the Ion meter would need a graphical update as well to show exactly how many ions you have ready to go instead of just a vague funny looking dragon bro.\n\nor just add sa to abyssal fang/skewer that works too i guess"

        "content": "Family Name: Luna_ValentynRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Corsair SuccessionSuggestion: Fix Bugs and Revamp the ClassDetails: The bugs listed on previous pages are thorough and well documented so I feel no need to reiterate. Please fix the bugs with the class in both awakening and succession. As for a revamp, this succession kit does not stand out as much as  previous classes; It seems to lack a gimmick. My suggestion for this would be to allow Succession Corsair to enter mermaid form during sword skills for added effects(please note these are rough ideas to help solidify the concept, not specific requests to be added to the feature) such as movement speed and/or potentially iframes on dive animations for Jet Stream and Sea of Dreams which have very long predictable wind up animations. This would be implemented similarly to how Succession Berzerker can enter Beast Form. This would add a significant amount of flavor to the class and fill out the intitial pitch of being a mermaid much more thoroughly. My following request for revamp ideas is to redo Prime: Hydropower. For any classes unfamiliar, that is Succession Corsair's \"Steroid\" buff or \"E\" buff. This skill does very little to interact with her kit at this point in time and is widely viewed as useless. Please let me explain why before jumping to conclusions. The +10 AP this skill provides is overridden by AP gained from other skills in her classic kit, Attack Speed does not effect mermaid skills, and Movement Speed also has no effect on mermaid skills. To top this off, the resistance buff does not add anything to mermaid skills because they are already Super Armor and the Grapple Resist is still negated by classes with increased grab strength because of the resistance cap. Mermaid Skills are one of if not the biggest asset to a succession corsair so for this buff skill to do nothing that benefits them in any way, it feels extremely detached and invalid. Sword skills do benefit from the speed boosts on this buff however they are just not use-able enough to merit the use of the skill. I would suggest the devs take a look into Prime: Hydropower and try to make it interact more with mermaid skills. This could be as simple as removing the bonus AP and resistences and adding extra hits to mermaid skills in my personal oppinion and/or reducing mermaid skill cool downs for the duration of the skill. It definately needs to interact with mermaid skills in some way though and the bonus AP is 100% useless. Please look into this."

Only 29.22% of a Shais damage is applied to Striker & Mystic enemies in PvP. As a result, Shai almost always loses fights even when she is significantly more geared than the opponents. This should be adjusted to allow Strikers & Mystics to take 42% of Shais damage, allowing them to remain the toughest opponents in terms of durability but still ensuring skillful Shais might be able to fend off attacks through superior player performance."

The only thing that makes succession tamer playable in pvp at equal skill right now is the grap and or out gearing ur opponent by a huge gap.The cc's and skills are slows for the best ones for an assassin class, the movements are all easy to read, you can litteraly tell where a succession tamer is gonna be everytime she moves unlike almost all the assassin classes (Ninja, Kuno, DK, Sorc, Hash, Lahn)\n\nThe spec lacks mobility, our only options are Evasion, Moonlight strike, Legendary beast power & Tree climb.Issue is, Moonlight and Tree climb both are bugged (no it's not desyncs) where u can lose ur SA or iframe sometimes for w/e reasons.\nAlso, Evasion is a none reliable movement since half of it is unprotected which is easily punishable by many classes without even knowing the gap due to the multiple hit ccs.\nSecond issue being the protections in general, yes succession tamer has good dmg on Frontal guards, but it makes them unusable sometimes in group fight for exemple, due to having players all around you (and some are just gonna wait for you to attack) and our skills being slow, so our only reliable, options are SAs, but those ones does litteraly no damage which makes tamer succession dmg output in grp fight really risky for the small reward, most classes can do more dmg while being perma SA with faster skills.\nRegarding the bugs, i already talked about the ones on Moonlight & Tree climb, but also Heilangs ccs are either bugged and or does not use the ignore resi of the player which makes it virutally useless, the game is already overloaded with SAs, making Heilang traps almost irrelevant, and the fact that those traps cannot punish players sometimes, makes you think about using them. ( I don't even play around any heilang traps anymore since reboot due to the issues with them).\nE-buff & passive are a joke, PA did say that they would make for each character a unique passive, and we are still running around with the most useless passive u could come up with, same for our e-buffs giving only defensive stats on a tamer, we have 0 way of survive anything, even at 401 DP DR 7K HP, vs any 260 AP class, u'll still get one combo'd with no issues.Also i would like to point at the amount unusable skills in the Succession kit, Allround Spinner, Flurry of Kicks, Stretch Kick, Evasive attack, Whipslash needs either a rework or swap them out.\nSuggestions for PvP : \n\n- Give Prime : Lightning of Earth a super armor, that would allow succession Tamer to have a protected re-cc (We don't have any).- Increase Resonance damage by 50%, and add critical rate 50% cause the skill is irrelevant right now, it's only purpose is to rotate SA.- Remove Prime : Allround Spinner, give succession another mobility option, this class is way too slow or rework the skill to something useful, like increase it's dmg by 30%, and add a float or bound or down smash and decrease the skill animation by at least half of it\n- Give tamer a real passive (Ignore grap res 30% or movement speed 20% or attack speed 10%) & e-buff (offensive stats like AP, Crit dmg, Atk speed, etc).- Make it so when we used Void lightning (Q) and Holding it, add a real 30% DR increase just like a self PA (the skill itself shows heilang protecting the tamer) which will allow us to at least stay in SA longer than 1 second.\n- Allows Heilang size modification, its size is a bit too big on succession some ppl might like it but sometimes u can't even see if the person is gettin re-cc'd or not due to him standing on top .\n- Fix the bugs, and make sure that heilang get our ignore resistance stats.\n- Reduce the cooldown of the Abosrb : Heilang to 4 minutes, 5:30 minutes is way too long for 8 AP / 10 DP, increase the AP / DP to 20 AP / 20 DP.\n- Remove the Tree climb extra attack when holding F, cause u can get it if someone stands in front of u at the moment u press the skill.\n- Improve the accuracy rate of some skills\n- Maybe improve the Evasion skill if there is no new mobility options, the evasion is way too easy to punish overall especially with the amount of slows in the game\n- Give Legendary Beast Power a movement speed self buff after using it (10 - 20%)\n- Add S block to succ tamer so we have room to breath and not burn all our cooldowns / take useless risk with evasion\n\nBelow i will put a table of everyskills in the tamer kit and how they are in pvp : \n\n- Good table is for skills that in my opinion are good as it is and doesn't need any changes.- Improvements table is mostly for the ones that needs either dmg, protections, animations or CD changes (or the one listed aboves).- Rework / bad is for the skills that are never used in PvP or for only one purpose which is useless.\n\n\n\n\nSkills that are good \nSkills are good but need improvements\nNeed a rework / skills are bad\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf some skills aren't present in this table, it's me never using them or having no thoughts.\n\nProbably my first & last feedback on Succession Tamer, due to PA mostly ignoring any feedbacks until now."

        "content": "Family Name: EmilimiaRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: PvP balance and PvE survivebility Details: \n - PVP\nFirstly I would like to address the recent changes to Succession DK that seem to be a hot topic.\n\n - Prime: Air Strike Super Armor: This was an essential change due to the simple fact that the skill has collision on other abilities for example a wizards meteor/blizzard, ranger or archer arrows would take you out of airstrike and instantly CC you. This issue was mostly apparent in largescale which Succession DK struggled in apart from very few VERY EXPERIENCED players. Removing collision from the ability would not be the correct way to \"fix\" this problem as doing so would result in the experiecned/good DK players not be able to do the outplays and flashy catches that they did previously by turning airstrike midway WITHOUT the use of mouse-move exploit. I have to say succ DK in NA largescale basically does not exist apart from 2-3 players and the longest standing being myself.\n\n\n\n- Twilight Dash -> Kamasylvia Slash combo: I would like to start with that previously this intraction was absolutly useless and never used. Now this intraction is useful and I firmly believe the complains are stemming from 1. Lack of expereicne agaisnt succession dark knight after these changes 2. playing the game witohut effects or sound which also applies to complaints agaisnt other classes such as Succession Hashashin which benfit from lack of player awareness of their position/skill being used. There are multiple classes that have protected cc's that go through frontal guard and cc'ing the opposing player and the said classes also have access to a grab which dark knight does not have access to. Additionally this helps alot in pve as previously you were required to full charge Kamasylvia Slash to get the damage and getting behind mobs was harder than the \"good\" pve classes with this change. This intraction is compared to kunoichis tendon cutter. however kunoischis tendon cutter is super armor which is not punishable without a grab and kunoichi has access to a grab. This Twilight Dash -> Kamasylvia Slash combo can be countered by doing a simple back dash -> cc or any iframe/SA will make the intraction ont work and the DK either gets caught or uses another major part of their mobility to get out.\n\n\n\nThe following are classes with protected cc's that go through/ignore fg protection from the front due to the ability being mobile and a cc and protected or cc'ing using summons with little to no counterplay:\nSueccession berserker: Weakling Hunt  - Awakening Vakyrie: Wave of light - Awakening Lahn: Core: Deadly Dance\n- Awakening Striker: Core: Spiral Cannon - Awakening Mystic: Core: Spiral Torpedo - Archer: Meteor Dive - Awakening Hashashin Core Sin splitter - Succession Nova - Succession Drakania: Prime: Markthanan's Flourish\n\n\n\nMost of the classes mentioned above also have access to a grab which dark knight doesn't. Classes with no grab should have tools that deal with the abundancy of protection this game has at its current state. Other than succ mae (rework needed) and to a very little extent awaken mae (make sleet steps iframe) now every non grab class is in a good/decent state.\n\n\n\nThese two changes have made the matchups that dark knight previously struggled with way more managable unlike what a certain non-dk player has said in this thread. Experienced/Good DK players have an understanding of punishing frontal guards since we do not have access to the free win button of grab and these changes help immensly with that as the classes that succ DK did struggle agiasnt just sat in permenant protection while the dk had to take risk after risk to make a punish happen. While this has made matchups such as ninja a bit in favor of DK given equall skill/gear its nowhere near the struggle of DKs had agaisnt their hard counter matchups previously. I have to say its ok to not win every matchup in class select since many players seem to not understand that.\n\n\n\nIt is also disinginous to state that now with these changes everyone can pick up succ dk and succeed. There are still very few Succession DKs participating in end game pvp content such as node wars and siege with success and the dks finding success in the current season of arena of solare are veteran DK players with years of expereicne and not to brag but in pre season the only dk that found succcess that was even close to the level of experiecne/skill was me. How come no one called DK not strong enough back then? Are players of other classes were just \"better\" than other DK players back in preseason? \n\nThe worst that sould happen to this combo is it being changed to not have a fg on kama when used with td, a straight up removal would hurt the class in other areas such as pvp\n\n\n\nPvE:\nThis one is short and simple as successsion dk is currently in a good spot in PvE.\n\nWhen using 100% BSR skills please add a few second of a big Monster Damage Reduction buff to all classes. classes such as succ dk that are sqishy and have rather long animations for their bsr suffer from getting heavily damaged while using their bsr. Adding a good amount of Monster Damage Reduction to bsr skills for a few seconds would mitigate this and would not affect PvP performance."

        "content": "Family Name: MikysakRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Archer (Awakening duh)Suggestion: Overall improvements to the class in generalDetails: Okey where to start...Well first something about myself i have \"mainded\" archer since its release at I believe 2018 and was here from his downs to his ups. I have participated in AoA Tournament where i ended up being 4th in EU. I am saying this only because it means that i should already know my class pretty much inside-out.I wanna just say that i love how you changed archer during the reboot aka rework. I really enjoy that we are finally able to deal dmg from afar and not only from the close range.Though for the last patch I gotta say that the new skill \"Sunfall\" is absolutely useless and there is nearly 0 reason to use it. I would suggest increasing the overall dmg of this skill by at least 20% in pve, decrease the dmg in pvp by 15% and add stiffen to it.Connectivity of the skills is pretty great nowadays, but i would suggest increasing the speed of connecting the marked bloom to other skills (ninja or hashbrown can literally use 5 skills before we can connect that skill to others, which really sucks considering we are locked in animation without any protection). Speaking about Marked bloom I would also like to say that this skill was a great addition to the archer skill raster, great for dmg from afar but mostly only if the target is already in kd.What i would really like to see though is increasing the surviveability of this class in pve. Leave pvp as is, archer is in an okey spot for pvp but we need to be able to survive more then two hits at spots like hexe or more then one hit at spots like oluns mainly considering that mobs at high end spots are non cceable and nearly all of our damaging skills are either unprotected (marked bloom, full bloom, grand bloom, uproot, arrow explosion, bolt of radience, earth shatter, covering fire, low sweep, ravenous talon) or sa (righteous smite, radiant explosion, spear of sylvia, piercing light, wrath of nature) thru which the dmg goes thru. I would suggest decreasing the dmg incomming from monsters by at least 10-15%. \n\nI would also suggest adding a flow with sa from one of the newer skills \"Wind Razor\" so the connection with Piercing Cry is more fluid or just leave Wind razor with iframe while moving and add sa whilst stuck in its end animation. Another option is to make the Wind razor skill animation cancelable by Piercing cry.\n\nIf storm of light should be useable I suggest shortenning its animation, nobody is gonna use a skill that has more then 4 seconds of an animation that you cant cancel from.\n\nNow i would like to mention the utter uselessness of most of the archers \"kick\" skills and a possible way to improve them. \n\nLets start from up to bottom.\n\nEarth Kick - The animation time is okey but the skill deals next to no damage, is unprotected and only has bound as cc on itself. Increase its damage from 764% x 3 to 1000% x 5, remove the bound and add frontal guard to this skill.\nVolant Kick - For this skill i would leave the protections be, I would remove the knockback and increased the dmg from 866% x 3 to 1250% x 3.\n\nPurging shot - Probably the only kick skill in archers kit that i would leave to be as is. Considering that it scales up from Volant Kick it would get an indirect buff from volant kick dmg increasement.\n\nAscending Spirit - Animation time is okey but the dmg is certainly not. Increase the dmg from 924 x 2 to 1250% x 2. Also addition of super armor or frontal guard might be required.\n\nVine Cutter - Again animation time is okey but i would increase the dmg from 744% x 3 to 1150% x 3.  Downsmash is perfectly fine on this skill.\n\nThe full combo of Gapping darkness -> Shadow Hack -> Vedure Clout needs a animation speed increase as well as damage increase both in pve and pvp in order to be useable. Vedure clout itself is usefull even without changes but only for the cc.\n\nFurther testing would be required to be able to determine the pvp decrease percentage required to balance the above mentioned skills as the goal of this commentary wasnt to increase archers damage output but to give archer more options of which skills to use during different situations. \n\nThanks everyone that managed to read this essey to the end. I hope that at least some of the stuff i managed to pour out from my general knowledge of this class is at least semi-usefull to the potentional change of this class.\n\nPostscript: Please do something about those poor shais they deserve so much more love from you guys then ever before. Revert the shai nerfs."

        "content": "Family Name: DudeauxRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Ninja AwakeningSuggestion: Fix our BSR skillsDetails: Sudden Decapitation was made into a Forward Guard skill with reboot, but yet the 10% BSR Sudden Decapitation loses its Forward Guard.Initially, I thought it was because it was intended to be a utility trade for the skill, but then recently it was revealed that 10% Sudden Decap. was applying CC's as a bug. Now, I think it is safe to say that 10% Sudden Decap. not having Forward Guard is also a bug. Kinda weird that only the useful bug got fixed, but not the hindering bug.Suggestion: Give it the Forward Guard that its base form already has.Serpent Ascension is a powerful skill, and it sounds really cool that it is also Ninja's 200% BSR.Except that it changes from a float to a stun, and even with the attack speed buff of using a 200% BSR, the skill is too slow to deal damage.Don't take my word for it, though, I implore you to try it yourself.Get an awakening ninja to use 200% Serpent Ascension on any class and you'll see that they'll get stunned, but they can act again before the damage comes out.Suggestion: Increase animation speed by 200%Drastic Measure 100% BSR is clearly only useful for PvE, as it deals less damage in PvP than the base form. It can't be canceled, it is very slow, and it is laughably weak. So weak that having 50% of that damage turned into the injury debuff is not only sub-optimal, but a blunder. Doing almost any other attack would be a better option in every PvP scenario. It's not even that reliable at dehorsing other players. Suggestion: Give it a knock down, or increase its PvP damage. I argue that BSR Katana Shower is a good PvP skill, and BSR Sura Chaospree is a good PvE skill and that neither of them need any significant changes.Blade Spin Blade 100% is still a joke, but that hasn't changed since the class released. Its damage is spread out and it's very slow. It's not protected in a meaningful capacity, so dying while you're doing it is not just likely but expected. It's too slow to be viable in PvE and PvP.If we're going to keep pretending like Ninja's gimmick is that he's fast, why is this the slowest 100% BSR in the game? Even when not landing hits, the skill has an animation slow-down(presumably for dramatic effect) that makes it almost too easy to kill a ninja while doing this BSR skill.Its flashy, over-the-top nature is a relic of this game's past, and I believe that the only reason this skill persists is because of a collective hopelessness in the community. We know that this skill won't get changed, no matter what, and we know that we'll never be told why.Suggestion: Increase the speed of the attack animations, do not change the concealed animation speed."

It would be understandable if the support that the Shai provided made up for the lack of protection and lack of damage in the pvp that the class has. I general its missing the pasives that classes have the protections on movements the caphras on the awakening weapon, the ability to sell/ buy the awakening weapon. The passive Lifeskill bonuses do little to nothing to improve the quality of life for the character as most of these are overcome in hours in the current game also the lack of movement on the character and sizable AoE makes it a subpar Lifeskill gatherer the only real advantage is the carry weight.\n\nAs far as pvp give her more defense/protections and passsives to match a support roles need to survive.  She is very small give her an evasion % passive, and Super Armor on her movement so just moving around isnt a death sentence. Her heals are pathetic for a support character at least one of them should be  percentage based and most of them should have there cooldowns lowered and healing increase substanualy. If she is suppose to be support make it so people have to target her first cause the support is that good. Currently killing the shai is and after thought she is more of a pest then a problem that is supporting her team.\nYou should not be punish for having a Shai and wanting to tag another character the fact that her \"\"Talent\"\" isnt considered and awakening weapon is silly. the caphras levels could just as easily add more % to the buffs / debuffs every few levels along with damage. all 3 buff should also be able to be had its silly to have to chose one it serves no real purpose all shai pretty much either go with Sun, Moon, Stars or Shout to the Sky.\nThe Rabam orb is also useless It dies in one hit in the current game again with the current damage in the game 350 health ever 7 second is a joke I die through front guard to a drak in 4 seconds.\nSo that being said for a rework drop the lifeskill part or lean more into it but pick a path on it. \nP.S. sorry if this is a little scattered writing this on a quick break"

While the stamina nerfs were warranted to limit her mobility in PVP her stamina at end game grind spots like Calpheon Elvia Hexe Sanctuary also suffered from the nerf. I think the easiest way to buff succ kunoichi without making her unbalanced in pvp is to eliminate the stamina cost from s-blocking. Currently when kunoichi S-blocks (blocking by walking backwards) in game it puts her into the Q-block (Kunai Block) animation when hit (in pvp or pve) and drains stamina. If you eliminate the stamina cost from being hit in S-block it gives succession kunoichi the ability to survive and regenerate some stamina to move again around hexe sanctuary mobs."

        "content": "Family Name: VnbzRegion: SAClass: Mystic (Succession)Suggestion: Succession Mystic balance ideasDetails: Succession Mystic current state is actually overtuned for where the kit shines - small scale, and it requires some adjustments.  As a day 1 Succ Mystic main i watched the class continuously getting buffed in the wrong way (adding more dmg) when in reality that was the wrong approach into her kit, making it too simple to the point its easy to learn and abuse but hard to master. The issue lies on the fact that the basics is already strong enough. Also we could have more depht if half of our kit wasnt actually locked and the other half wasnt 50% situational leaving us with a Thunderpound / Soulbasher spam for core gameplay. Here are my suggestions:\n\n Grab - Currently our grab have a 15s CD which is fine, given that the reboot gave us more mobility and more stamina management options but introduced a huge gap because our most common engage revolves around Flash Step into Grab, so Flash Step ending is unprotected and Grab start is also unprotected, making the skill more risky than it should (can check the gap here: https://streamable.com/uvf5vr) \n\nFix: Change the grab CC type from Knockdown to Bound but fix the gap ON SUCESSFULL GRABS ONLY - old state was slightly fast SA on every attempt, which is not our current pattern for grabs balancing, but we shouldnt be punished by being able to play well and land the grab just because the game wants to. We need this addressed as it greatly impacts our Mass PvP / turning fights potential given that gauntlets overall eat too much dmg anyway. \n\n\n\n Prime: Sea Burial - Remove Seal Burial Shard spender capabilities. \nReason: This skill damage is bad with or without shards, and is mostly used as movement and stamina management. Most of the time you will end up wasting your 3 Shards with it in situations where you dont want to. PLEASE DONT GIVE US THE DAMAGE BUFF TREATMENT!!!\nFix Sea Burial interaction with falling animation, giving it more head room. We cant even use Twisted Collision > Sea Burial in any slightly irregular terrain because it will just get you killed. (Example: https://www.twitch.tv/vnbz_/clip/OutstandingPlumpMouseShazBotstix-ZQdRLVoZ4nNY3CXU?filter=clips&range=30d&sort=time)\nReason: Pretty please? \n\n\nStaggering - I dont know if theres much you can do about the Staggering effect that happens when you are getting hit by multiple skills and that accelerates the skills animations / protections as it seems to be a engine problem, but given that Mystic is a short ranged class, most of the time we are on those situations, making our protections end too soon or giving weird interactions. Most notably skills that suffers from that are Sea Burial, Rage Hammer and Flash Step. \n\n\n\nStamina Cost on dmg skills - I think Mystic is one of the few classes that have stamina costs as requirement for dmg skills, so remove stamina cost for  Somersault,  Adamantine and  Triple Flying Kick\n\n\n\nRemove / Add skill interactions:\n\nRemove:\n  Prime: Tornado Kick into Prime: Hidden Claw prioritizes Hidden Claw connection into last hits KD. Please remove that interaction as we dont wanna use Hidden Claw as dmg outside of 1v1 combos and we definitely dont wanna use that sequence either for our 1v1 combos because we got better options.\n\nAdd:\n  Prime: Flash Step into Prime: Rage Hammer gapless. Succ mystic is a connection spec, which means we must connect one skill into another to cancel the previous skill gap or flow the animation better. On the case of rage hammer, we are forced into weird interactions like Flash Step > Sea Burial > Rage Hammer or Flash Step > Mass Destruction 1 hit > Rage Hammer. By giving us the ability to cancel Flash Step Gap with Rage Hammer we would be able to have more skilled options and plays given that we are constantly cancelling Flash Step gap somehow.\n\n Absolute: Rib Crusher into  Prime: Tornado Kick. This is more of an attempt based on suggestion i gave up further in this post. By adding said linkage we would be able to do sequences like   on a Knocked down target for a safe protected damage filler without applying CCs unintendly (considering all changes i suggested to our kit) \n\n\n\n\n Thrashing Wolf - Reduce the cooldown from 15s to 12s. Allow us to cancel the animation lock portion with Silent Step, Mass Destruction, Crouching Wolf, Flash Step (those four are already our current cancels) before the last hit portion.\nReason: Gives us more room for gameplay.\n Raging Wolf - Reduce the cooldown from 25s to 15s. Pretty weak rabam overall, Awakening can maintain 3 shards uptime most of the time, Succession can gen said shards easily too. Atleast reducing the cooldown this rabam might be used for 1v1s where you cant stack shards that easily? i dont know, feels lackluster overall, could be something else instead.\n\n Mass Destruction - Change all hits CC to first hit only. Change Stun to Stiffness on hit.\nReason: Balancing issues. We currently have way too much protected CCs\n\n Prime: Soulbasher - Current state is a noob trap. 3s Cooldown perma lingering SA? wow thats too good to be true, right? except the skill does 0 dmg, makes you stationary and is too slow/clunky to be used in any serious PvP. Also it takes away some of class learning curve because if you dont know what to do you just press F for a safeguard, which is a bad design overall.\nFix: Raise the cooldown to 6~8s but make the skill actually do something by improving the cast speed to simillar levels of thrashing wolf 3rd rabam, so it can be used as filler dmg which we lack. Also, if going that route, remove the Downsmash proc and maybe give 25% PvP crit.\n\n\n\nPrime: Thunderpound - Obnoxiously OP skill when our kit is mastered but also a noob trap. 3s Cooldown Frontal Guard with Downsmash proc, decent filler dmg, decent range, Stiffness into Knockdown and cancelling seamlessly into most of our kit? I would dare to say its our core and most important skill on the kit, and new players will spam it alot and get punished, which is ok, but current state is too much packed.\nFix: You can either raise the CD to 5s or change the Knockdown effect to Bound. This skill is kinda tricky to change because its also one of the window people have to punish Succ Mystic and basically her identity move, so proceed carefully on that one if you are not making real changes to the rest of the kit.\n\n\n\nCombo: Hurricane - Not a well known Prime skill because its hidden, but it has actually some good damage, but overall locked because input conflicts with Tornado Kick flowing from Thunderpound.\nFix: Change the input from F after Thunderpound to RMB after Thunderpound so we can actually unlock this skill and have some niche uses.\n\n\n\n Prime: Somersault - Add Super Armor to the skill. If we are following the changes into giving us an actual kit where we rotate more than 7 skills, then we need some actually usable fillers. Remove stamina cost as suggested before.\n\n\n\nPrime: Scissor Kick - Enable Tier 2 Addon choices for it, given that we are lacking on the useable addons department.\n\n\n\n Prime: Fist Fury - Make Frontal Guard backstep protection linger throught entirety of First Hit, similar to how Prime: Hidden Claw works.  Current this skill has close to no use, its unprotected, slow, it might be used as shard gen mid combo or backup float but honestly? its redundant, we have better options, simillar on how Hidden Claw is mostly used as iframe instead of combo piece, having another movement tool would be great.\n\n\n\n Flow: Sky Rammer - Remove Bound CC. Lower CD to 10s. Increase AoE radius by 50%. Currently we have no ways to cancel Landslide huge gap other than Sky Rammer. Also its our main climbing ability, and its already way worse than Strikers option, so having better up time would help a bit. As for the AoE radius, its focused on making Twisted Collision addons more appealing, like it is for striker.  \n\n\n\n Flow: Strikethrough - Remove Bound CC. Make this skill Invencible when vanishes into Superarmor with a gap that can be canceled through other skills like Crouching Wolf. Raise the CD to 10s. Currently this skill is useless because using it means getting CCed.\n\n\n\n Absolute: Rib Crusher - Swap Knockdown with Frontal Guard. This follow up is already fast enough if target is caught by Elbow Edge, but current Elbow usage is more like a disengage tool. By swapping CC to Frontal Guard, we would be able to use Disengaging Elbow into Rib Crusher from distance for a fast stamina recovering Frontal Guard. Also it would enable more combo variety, which we currently lack. \n\n\n\n Prime: Roaring Tiger and  Prime: Wave Orb - We have two approaches for those skills; Wave Orb is too much packed, altho its also our main dmg skill, meaning that we have to actually chose wether to use it as a Slow or Damage. Usually you wanna run it for slows, then we have a 10s 37% slow (with addons) in a huge area, which is protected, hits for a decent amount even without shards, and lingers Super Armor. Reminds you of Guts, the guy you just guted right? (pun intended). Roaring is by far our least used spender because unprotected and too much CC so heres my suggestions to fix both skills:\n\n\nFirst Scenario - Thunderpound getting Knockdown swapped by Bound Route:\nPrime: Roaring Tiger - Add Super Armor effect and 25% crit rate. Raise the CD to 6s\nPrime: Wave Orb - Remove Super Armor effect\nReason:  Following my previous suggestions, with Thunderpound getting Knockdown removed and Grab becoming gapless but bound, we would be left with only Sweeping Kick as a Knockdown option for group PvP, so making Roaring Tiger our signature spender instead would fit the theme kinda well. Wave Orb damage being untouched and unprotected would be left as a risky AoE slow and a Huge Dmg combo piece, giving room to actual skill instead of im perma slowing you approach.\n\n\nSecond Scenario - Increasing Thunderpound cooldown route:\nPrime: Roaring Tiger - Add Frontal Guard or Super Armor. Remove Knockdown and Downsmash. Raise the CD to 6s\nPrime: Wave Orb - Damage without shards reduced by 5%. Damage with shards reduced by 15%. Slows reduced from 30% to 20%. Cooldown increased to 14s.\nReason: This would be a more conservative change and would make Wave Orb less oppressive while still making it usefull. In this route, Roaring Tiger becomes the go to filler damage spender, which we lack.\n\nBoth changes suggested aims on making Roaring Tiger more appealing and Wave Orb less of a win button.\n\n\n\n Prime: Rage Hammer - Add 25% Crit for PvP. Change unsharded multiplier from 10% to 20%. Currently the unsharded damage is too high but its also incosistent. With those changes the idea is giving more consistent damage to this skill, altho numbers might need future adjustments if still too strong.\n\n\n\nUnadressed flows (Hidden Claw Tree, Thunderpound Tree, Adamantine Tree) - Honestly those are all dated skills and would require a complete rework as they offer no connections, most of them are unprotected while having no damage whatsoever and too much CC.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Those suggestion changes are aimed into making Succession Mystic being able to rotate more skills instead of the forced spam that we get on current state. I addressed things like skill ceilling, making the class a bit harder to pilot but having actual options for damage and filler damage. The current gameplay is really fluid and fun but basically revolves around getting shards via Thunderpound and using a big damage spender like Rage Hammer or Wave Orb, giving us not alot of options other than stalling for those big impact skills. Please, keep in mind that if you just apply a nerf to this spec instead of a balance adjustment, she might fall too short like current Succession Kunoichi is and people will just migrate to her op brother, so yes. Feel free to dm me on discord at Vnbz#4352, i will be happy to discuss changes to the spec if needed. \n\nIf it serves any purpose, i played the class for a long time for good results in group PvP, so most of my suggestions are aimed at making the class have more depht.\nI would also like to see the carpeting thing addressed, like making both gauntlets actually killable on the floor but slightly more tankier when rotating protections correctly through some sort of sustain mechanic, but that would actually require a 2.0 rework at this point. Still, thats something you guys will have to address at some point. The class must be tanky for group content because you eat alot of damage, but that also breaks 1v1 / small scale experience for other players."

        "content": "Family Name: ArtlockRegion: EUClass: Valkyrie (Awakening)Suggestion: Vakyrie Awakening Overall Improvement SuggestionsDetails: Awakening Valkyrie is in a good state in terms of both PvE and PvP but still suffers from quite a bit of clunkiness issues that have plagued the class since its release. Below are a few points that could be improved in that regard.\n\nValkyries do not currently have a reliable iframe. It would be interesting for the 0.1s iframe on Side+LMB (Lancia Training) to be extended to 1s instead, with the addition of a short cooldown, say 5 seconds. This is currently an iframe provided by an auto attack skill but I don't see a reason why auto attacks couldn't keep their full effect during the cooldown time, with the exception of the improved iframe effect.\nSanctitas de Enslar's landing cannot be cancelled out of for a duration. This makes it hard to use that skill offensively against grab classes, since it is very easy to grab an immobile Valkyrie during that animation. Allowing to escape the animation faster would make using the skill aggressively as more of an option.\nSanctitas de Enslar's 100% black spirit rage also forgets to apply the +20 melee AP that the base skill normally gives.\nDivina Impulsa is very slow and cannot be cancelled out of. It even forces all three attacks to come out before giving back control. Being able to cancel the animation during or in between the hits would improve its usability in fast paced PvP scenarios in which the skill currently feels useless.\nPurificatone's area of effect and visuals could be improved. It is difficult right now to tell the distance and angle at which the skill connects. It also feels like it often misses mobs on the sides or on the pack of packs in PvE, which is important for a DP debuff.\nWave of Light provides block during the charging animation but there is a delay between casting the skill and the start of charging. Due to this the forward guard effect starts late which creates a protection gap during the initial windup. Because of this it is rarely worth trying to get a full cast out. Removing that gap would give an incentive to use the full version of the skill while still leaving a gap in protection in the form of back attacks.Vindicta is a nice slow but is incredibly hard to use for multiple reasons. It is currently a melee range skill with no aoe size and a clunky activation condition. I would like for it to have a small cone aoe, for example half of the current aoe size of Purificatone, which would make it easier to apply the debuff on classes that do not require being directly up in your face. I would also like to be able to activate it from a quickslot as the current input is very unpractical, requiring to be in block stance.Shining Judgement of Light (Rabam) and Absolute: Shining Dash have long wind up times that make them hard to use. Considering the slow movement and low range of these dashes by today's standards, I think these windups should be greatly sped up or completely removed. This would make PvP movement on Valkyrie less of a hastle and reduce its clunkiness overall.\nIf you made it here, thank you for taking the time to read through, I know this wasn't a short post!\n\nAddendum about Succession\nSuccession is a whole other matter and I wouldn't dare open it considering I have never touched it. My only experience there is playing pre-awakening before the release of Succession and Awakening. I do know though that the performance of Succession in both PvE and PvP leaves a lot to be desired, at the very least in terms of damage output. I would be interested in trying it but in its current state it is simply not worth the effort. Give it some love too!"

You'll see I have a slow on me at the start of the animation, but it falls off and get stunned out of the iframe animation regardless.\n\n*Prime Beast Demolisher, Torso Ripper, Rockslide and Strike Down: totally useless skills every player locks and never ever uses.  I don't have any ideas for these but it'd be great if something was done to them to make them interesting ability choices.\n\n*Full frontal guard on Prime Mutilation would be helpful in all areas of PVP.  I can't see why this skill has the big gap in frontal coverage, especially in large-scale.  You're a bit screwed if you don't have your e-buff ready with the super armor buff to cover the gap. \n\n*Our performance in PVE is extremely average :("

Whenever Sage is entering the Riftchain, the special effect animation created is a massive hitbox. Travel should remain Super Armor when used on CD once moving, but a duration of  ~.5 seconds iframe needs to be added in the beginning of the skill to ensure you’re not punished for doing what most players can do naturally, evade damage/grabs. Increase Riftchain speed 10%. Allow to flow in to Formshift/Recall and Spearbolt smoothly regardless if Riftchain is on cooldown or not.\nDetails: Sages are severely limited due to very slow cast speeds compared to the amount of outgoing damage especially in endgame pve outside of ebuff. This time is increased when needing to reposition to avoid damage. The longer you’re in Riftchain trying to avoid Mobs or Players is considerably less time you have to apply damage or pressure back all while burning copious amounts of your own stamina. And due to issues like Super Armor Riftchain creating an artificial hit box over 4x the size of Sage AND being a live hit box even after Sage begins to move away, means you have to play more cautiously then any other class with a fast dash because if that hit box is within a Red Mob’s AOE or players grab field, despite Sage being out of range, the damage will transfer. This has been tested and confirmed by several Sages in the Succession Sage discord, in game and several players are aware of this bug as well, some of which admit to even exploiting it. It is a serious exploit that causes issues hurting Sage's ability to grind in spots other classes can easily, even when in SA because their hitboxes don't stretch to almost ~6x their normal size. This also HEAVILY effects PVP and is clearly evidenced by Sage's AOS rankings and all too common complaints that entering SA Riftchain is a death trap. SA Riftchain kills most Sages due to the amount of damage we take in it. If more evidence is required, please let me know. \nMassive SA Riftchain Bugs - https://youtu.be/EtD4Uq8Vzls \nEven when players aren’t facing the Sage himself but one of the special effects, it’s still pulled back in. You’d think this distance ( https://imgur.com/a/iKArqOz  ) would be safe from a Kuno’s melee based grab, especially when she’s facing the opposite direction, but the SA Riftchain Bug above comes in to effect - https://youtu.be/Xiym5-DPYAI This bug is the result of over 80% of my deaths when Grinding and a significant amount in PVP as well. The Trail AND the starting location are susceptible to any and all attacks."

I think removing stamina from chain crash could help awaken kuno in PvE lowering the APM making newer players more interested in her aince right now she has one of the higher APM + a high amount of skills on CD at one time. If tendon doesnt get reverted to using WP again. \nPlease dont hate Awaken Kuno \n---------------------------\nAlso  figure out away to make desync less of a issue. Right now desync causes most of the issues with nearly all classes. People with over 100ms  notice things like protections not working properly or ccs causing the other player to float an rubberband to another spot. Which gives the impression the other person is exploting when its just the way the game handles values(evasion Dr and so-on) of fights.\n\n\nA way you could mitigate this issue for NA at least is let OCE have their own server this could also in turn increase the player base."

Due to her height, logic wise it should be harder to grab a shai, as most of the time a sitting duck in the battlefield we are the first targets to get grabbed or focused. So with that said it would only be fair to give us sitting ducks a grapple resistance passive. Also, I believe a damage reduction passive should be fair for Shai in reason that every single other class has a defensive passive, why not Shai? Especially as most of the time we are the opponent's first target because they know Shai is vulnerable in that way. Shai should be the tank that some DPS classes are."

Righeous smite (for me) on fair occasion blows up on me coming out of the bow. Full bloom pointless with any form of elevation. Many moves have little to no range on hills (play blue team in RBF Valencia).\nMoves dont do damage after you die (for example) if I got righeous smite off and a split second later died, I get to watch that projectile hit its target and do absolutely no damage.\n\nWe need a boost to defence/survivability: (i kind of got stuck on how to word this so might seem kind of like a rant) Im not saying I dont know how to kite but a lot of classes now can fly across the map and be on you before you even get a move off now -  Im 360 DP, I think thats fair amount but im farly commonly one shot threw my forward guard. Like anyone you ask youself how you could of done better, if I used a superarmor id be jst as dead! An invicible - they last half a second and (for me) near never register, you can watch it go off but ill die during the move anyways. With that point im trying to make said and mildly contradicting to my suggestion if the defence part of the class stays the same and we continue to be fragile then perhaps make Glide or even piercing cry an invincible while keeping it on its current CD. It would certinly help us stay ranged and be a more effective kiter. Regardless of my suggestion, defensively we need help.(A quote I once read) Archer, a class thats fairly enjoyed by most but rarely played and even less so seriously."

I would like to take some of his damage out of Titan Blow and turn one of his awakening skills into a range damage non CC skill such as Blasting or Scatter Shot. This will allow awaken berserker to still contribute in a fight so he is not doing 9k damage in AoS because a DK, ninja, striker, warrior wanted to hold W at him.

        "content": "Family Name: DeportedSmurfRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Musa (Awakening)Suggestion: Awakening musa nerf ideas.Details: Awakening musa is currently way too strong. Here are a few suggestions to improve the kit in more fair and balanced way:\n\nThere is too much super armor in the kit. Currently, musa does not ever have to cast a skill that is not super armor. This makes it way too easy to go in, kill opposing players, and get out. The skill \"One-Step Back\" should be changed to a frontal guard. This would add a risk factor when the musa wants to reposition as well as adding counter-play for those who are fighting against the musa. \n\nThe CCs are too strong. Currently, there is a knockdown effect on \"Searing Slam\" and \"Dash Slash.\" \"Searing Slam\" is already super armor and a very large AOE, it should not also have the strongest CC in the game. Changing this to a bound effect would be much healthier. \"Dash Slash\" should also be changed to a float. This skill is already extremely strong because of how low the cooldown is and the 10% bsr makes it hit extremely hard. Musa having knockdown effects on several skills makes it way too easy to kill anyone you hit. \n\nThe slows are too much. The slow effect should be removed from \"Searing Slam.\" There is already a slow on \"One-Step Back\" and having it on \"Searing Slam\" as well is much too strong. \n\nTLDR: Musa has too much super armor, cc, and slowing effects. The class is way too easy to play with little to no counterplay. This creates an extremely unfun gameplay experience for players fighting against the musa, and leaves no room for an experienced musa to express their skill."

Adding extra DR or Evasion as a passive or active skill buffs would help the melee caster not buckle on the frontlines. Wizard has a higher base evasion stat than Witch just as a class difference so even matching that would help.Another approach would be the ability to put Super Armor on some supportive skills when in Awakened spec such as Healing Aura or Healing Lighthouse. At a melee range it can be very dificult to properly buff, heal, or generally support your allies when none of the relevant skills have any protection and take some time to cast."

        "content": "Family Name: Mishailia\nRegion: NA\nClass: succession lahn\nSuggestion: Give the class more depth \nFirst off Succession Lahn is in a good spot. I think it does well in AoS and in node wars/siege. Im mostly posting ways to give the class more depth for players who put the time into it. The rework addressed her flying mechanic which it took me a long time to get used to but it wasnt anything i was excited about which lead to me quitting the game and i havent been wanting to play it. \n\nNow to the point of this post, I have a few suggestions. First one would be making the end of prime: cymbidium a hotkeyable move. When we do the move its in 3 parts. First part is a frontal and the lahn slaps the ground with her weapon. Second is a dash forward which then leads into a powerful damaging move (very close to vice). I suggest making that dash forward and slash or just the flash a separate move. This will give succession lahn more combo options and upfront damage so we can kill quickly and get out. \n\nSecond suggestion is, Bleeding hearts rework or change. This skill is pretty useless other than to get buffs while grinding. Ive seen some lahns use it for an SA move but other than that it does nothing for our kit. If you dont want to do the first suggestion i recommend replacing bleeding hearts with vice or maybe bridled despair or deadly dance. This again will give the succ lahn more combo options and sudo movement options as well to outplay their opponent. \n\nThird suggestion, Succ lahn can feel boring at times because its the same combo over and over again alot of the times. Id like to see a mechanic that rewards the lahn for hitting their skills by enhancing the next skill with buffs that stack up together. For example if you hit morning dew a few times in a row you get a buff that stacks with it. \n\nFourth suggestion, crescent barrage. This skill got some love during the rework by making it faster. The issue with this skill is that the damage is at the very end of it. Again this class is an assassin class and it would help alot if the skill had the damage in the first part of the skill which is unprotected and then keep the SA heal towards the end of it. This leaves the cancel combo pend kick -> crescent with more burst damage. \n\nThe conclusion to this long post is that succession lahn needs to have more depth to it. So the player can have more tools to outplay their opponent and not get bored while doing it. When you are fighting skilled opponents they know you have very limited options to kill them. so they will sit back and watch for our only engage which is salpuri. Adding more depth to the class will give the succession lahn ways to counter this. \n\nOn another subject, and way more important than anything I said above, Castle siege needs to be reworked to keep the game more exciting. When guilds fight for a castle its just the guilds pushing being farmed by the defender guild because you need to funnel into a small tunnel and get hit by high damage range skills and if you survive that you most likely will lag out and crash. This leads to scripted fights that are the only way siege fights happen now because it is impossible to push without more than one guild. Spreading out the fighting will lower the lag and make the fights not just fun.... but actually playable. I suggest adding buffs around the map that the flex team or offense needs to fight for. If you get this buff you get something to help you push forward into the castle or defend."

She can pretty much do any content, given you have the gear, and run either evasion or dr. The only changes I believe she needs are quality of life ones. First, shadow slash, our atk speed prebuff and minor unprotected movment. There's really no reason for it to have a stam drain and wouldn't cause any change in gameplay aside from being able to freely move. Additionally this would help to buff our stam in pve without changing much about the overall class preformance. Lastly q block draining stamina, this really doesn't make any sense and feels more like a nich gimmick that was forgotten about. It's pretty awful needing to rely on your s block to regen stamina only to get hit and have your stamina go down. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if they didn't remove 2 of our sa lingers during the reboot :/. \n\nFamily Name: FlorangRegion (NA/EU): NA Class (Awakening/Succession): ShaiSuggestion: Overall class changes for both pve and pvp.Details: \nPVP: First an evasion passive and/or dr passive. As a pvp class shai really only has the option to build dp which is held back by the fact that she has only a 6% evasion prebuff and middle of the back base evasion. An easy fix would be a simple 10% evasion passive. Furthermore in pvp we need more options. The increased cd on misty haze has left shai with a pretty garbage playstyle of buff bongo or occassionally every few minutes use bubble, debuff, or come out come out. I think a possible fix would be to allow shai to have come out come out on a 30s cd so we have a means to engage into ball fights protected. Additionally changes to our two other talent bongo skills are neccessary. One idea could be to give tremble a % block break and sun's fury a vacuum. With how slow they are this shouldn't be too strong given their cds are adjusted, but obviously testing would be needed. Other qol changes for shai would be e buff animation length, buffs of higher level not overwriting other with other shais, t3 addon, and low amount of ccs/no kds. \nPVE: Shai was very strong at a few spots and very very bad at every other spot. As it currently stand it does feel like we lack damage compared to other classes now at spots such as hexe, trolls, gyfin, sycraia, orcs, etc. I think the simple fix would just be to revert our damage. I don't see the problem with shais damage being higher than 80% of the classes at end game spots with end game gear. With 309k the majority of classes could pull similar numbers, within 10%, at most spots, except oluns, and with our terrible low end grinding/any spot that needs to move I think it's a fair trade to have. If reverting our damage is that much of an issue then they need to find a way to make shai viable at pack to pack/lower end grind spots since in her current state she's mid and end game and the worst and anything early on/potition spots."

Having most of the damage on Cleansing Flame and God Incinerator, both skills being extremely telegraphic and easy to avoid, makes the class unable to perform reliably. A decent amount of classes are able to deal more damage at a significantly faster rate, which makes our \"tankiness\" irrelevant today as our heal passive means nothing, and able to move significantly faster than us. This makes Guardian itself unable to perform outside of Largescale fights against players unless they haven't fought a Guardian before, because of the slow animations Awakening has and both specs unable to cancel their abilities quick enough.\n\nSuggestion? Change the AP passive to attack speed, buff our heal passive to be x2 the amount OR allow us to remove slows similar to Succession Drakania. Make the I-frame part on Fierce Disdain slightly longer to give us a more reliable iframe. Remove Prime:Mutilation gap. Make both grabs register on characters with no collision (Our grabs literally go through no collision targets) video link OR just make it just the same as most other grabs that are melee ranged but instant. Reduce the cooldown for Mountain's Echo to 10s at LEAST, also please fix the falling animation on this, as you instantly get this when using it down the slightest slope. Make Rockslide significantly faster and similar to Berserker's Predatory Hunt. Make both pre-Awakening and Awakening Juggernaut be instantly max speed instead of a ramp up. Maybe make Prime: Beast Demolisher relevant? Since 40% of our abilities are locked because they are useless, Rockslide being barely useful. Strike Down, Flow: Low Blow, Beast Demolisher, Torso Ripper, Fervor, Juggernaut: Smite being these useless skills in just pre-Awakening alone. EDIT: Increase the duration of the attack speed buff on Fierce Disdain to 20s, putting our only attack speed buff that is only 10s long on our main skill we use conservatively in PvP to help mitigate damage and attempt to avoid grabs is very questionable.\n\nAwakening specifically, make Glorious Advance attack Speed 20 seconds long OR, ideally, make it a baseline passive for Awakening. Cleansing Flame float should be baseline and the skill itself should be sped up as it is slow enough for any class to avoid it. Scalding Thorn needs to be instant for it to be relevant or give it protection so it gives us another CC option outside of Cleansing Flame and grab. Make Dragon's Maw relevant, the skill is too slow and does no damage even at max charge with E buff, I believe making it instantly charge and increasing the damage by roughly 20% would make it a viable skill to use. Buff both Cleansing Flame and God Incinerator BSR attacks so they are relevant to use or make them faster. Flow: To Ashes, this skill is essentially another useless skill in PvP, remove the Bound and add FG with an increase of damage. Infernal Steps is also useless, but I think there's plenty of suggestions to work on.\n\nI am not asking for ALL of these suggestions necessarily, these are just suggestions for the balance team to work off of."

        "content": "Family Name: HocRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Witch AwakeningSuggestion: Buff PvP and PvEDetails: I would like to see pets have some PvE crit hit rate or even PvP as well (both would be amazing). Currently, as a Witch for example, all of the pet flows have 0% Critical Hit Rate. This means that you are FORCED to run the Deathblow Lightstone set for PvE to have your pets do good amounts of Critical Hits. +5 Crit stat = 18% Critical Hit Rate. Deathblow Lightstone set = 14% Critical Hit Rate, Skill addons would be +20% Critical Hit Rate. So, for a pet they would only have 52% PvE Critical Hit Rate. If you remove the Deathblow Lightstone set (for PvP) you'd have a total of 38% Critical Hit Rate with your pet. Critical Hits are huge for damage so it would be very good if ALL PETS at had like some base Critical Hit Rate like 25% or even 50% for PvE at least. I would love to have them be in PvP as well to help make the class stronger in PvP for their awakening kits since they are balanced around those pets but they do not do enough damage in the current meta. Also, there has been proof that the Accuracy % on pets are NOT WORKING AS INTENDED. Meaning it currently only works for PvE and NOT PvP even though it says it is for both PvP AND PvE. Consider lowering the cooldown of Witch/Wizard's Elementalization to something much more usable like 7s or so. 15s is too high to make use of it and this meta you need to be able to move or you die. We take too much damage in our Super Armor spells now that everyone has high AP, so we just stand there and die. Please look into alleviating this maybe by adding higher DR to the Super Amor spells. All of the Awakening kit is too slow for both PvP and PvE and should have their animations increased. They are way too slow for the current meta and hinder the class too much since the no one is scared to run into the Witch's AOE anymore. They know they can outtrade it and kill you. That aspect of Awakening Witch needs to be looked at and changed accordingly either by having them do more damage or having higher DR on the spells so you take a lot less damage than you currently do."

Part of that is because the class's stamina consumption has been aggressively tweaked, utility taken away, and overall damage output relatively low. That being said, I understand that our class buff contributes to why stamina continues to be one of lahn's weaknesses, but still our consumption outside of our class buff is a bit too harsh. These changes would significantly improve Lahn's standing while not over-improving the class:\nAbsolute: Sacred Dance - Revert to pre-reworks and add a knockdown in pvp. (This change would provide some utility as well as a stamina recovery option)\nBridled Despair - Increase pvp damage by 7%.\nDeadly Dance - Increase pvp damage by 6% and allow stamina recovery.\nBlood Moon Twist - Allow the post-cast animation to be canceled with phantom dance after cancelling the initial windup with preceeding skills like Vice or Bloody Stride.\nEradication - Allow stamina recovery.\n\nLahn PVE: Lahn's glaring issue in PVE is a matter of damage and aoe. Understandably, the aoe issue is hard to tackle because that directly affects pvp as well.

        "content": "Family Name: ByroRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Succession Valkyrie Suggestion: PVP and PVE Buff Details:  Going off the point that majority of classes in the game have gotten buffed since the major reworks happened, I believe Succession Valkyrie would be considered a bottom end class in both PVP and PVE aspects of the game. Looking into the damage category of Succession Valkyrie, it is outclassed by nearly any other class in the game currently. The DPS output a succ valk can put out at the 309 ap bracket would be outdamaged by plenty of others classes such as Zerker, Witch/Wizard, Musa/Maewha, Dark Knight, Striker/Mystic, Ranger, Hashashin, Drakania at a much lower ap bracket (ex: 297). I understand that some classes will outdamage others, however being outdps'ed by the majority of classes in the game with 3 or more ap brackets lower is insanely unfair. This component also affects mob clear speed, making Succession Valkyrie a bottom tier PVE class. \n   Onto the next category: movement. In the current state of the game, Succ Valk is most likely the 3rd slowest class in the game slightly above Succession Nova and Shai. If any class besides the two I just listed wanted to run away from Valkyrie, they are able to. It should not be the case that Succ Valk's movement is so awful to the point where it is unable to keep up with the other classes in the game. Players are allowed to pick and choose fights with a Succession Valkyrie simply due to the fact that they know the Valk would be unable to catch up and the Valk would have no control over it. I do however understand that Valkyrie is revolved around the Q block mechanic in the game so it's reasonable for it to be on the slower end but I do genuinely believe the class's movement kit needs a either a buff or a huge rework. My own personal suggestion would be to add an extra shield chase into the kit or reduce the cd's of our shield chases. \n   Another issue with Succession Valkyrie in my opinion is our BSR skills that need a complete rework. There really isn't one BSR skill that we have that is worth using in pretty much any scenario. A rework into this category would help out the class a great amount. \n   The last point I wanted to make is that after 2020's Arena of Arsha tournament, the 1st and 2nd place winners were invited to the Adventurer's Round Table and gave advice on the class. The winners have stated that alot of the feedback that they provided was not taken account into when reworking the class. I believe that my feedback resonates pretty similarly to their feedback also and hope that my feedback would be taken notice of. At the current state of the game, I believe that Succession Valkyrie struggles extremely in mid-scale pvp, large-scale pvp, and pve content. I would consider the class a decent small-scale pvp class, and a strong 1v1'er. I hope that the feedback I provided would improve the class in the areas of the game that Succession Valkyrie struggles with."

Been through some rough times with the class but it improved a lot after reboot. But still need quite some changes that was not addressed during the reboot. In PVP when it comes to big fights like nw or siege class performs really well because of the ranged damage. But the class still feels very lacking when it come to 1v1 or small fights.Things in my opinion that are holding back class in 1v1 and small fights:- Slow animation speed and lack of animation speed+ movement speed buffs, along with slow debuff from other classes makes the class too slow- Most classes in the game now have fast fully protected long distance chase/Dash/Teleport skills, makes it almost impossible to kite or keep the range more than 2 or 3 seconds- Archer does not have long distance protected Dash/Teleport skills- Cannot do any damage while getting chased especially if its a grab class or classes with long range protected CC skills- High damage skills are unprotected or slow/long animation- Inability to keep up when getting chased due to high stamina cost on skills. Archer needs to chain multiple skills to move around while getting chased and stay protected. And after a certain time getting chased the stamina becomes hard to recover especially against fast moving classes with grabs and low stamina requirement.- Too squishy, kiting class or ranged class shouldn't be tanky, but right now Archer is too squishy. At high gear score some classes can kill Archer with two skills no matter the dp, makes it almost impossible to damage trade.\nNow i will list some changes that can improve Archers 1v1 and small fight situation:- Animation and Movement speed +20% buff, lower some skill cool down according to it.- Either give Give Archer a Protected fast long distance Dash/Teleport skill or give Archer more iframes to deal with fast moving grab classes.- Archer currently have 3 reliable iframes and one of them requires bsr. So give Archer more iframes skills or Defense buff to deal with being too squishy.- Replace pre-awakening melee kick skills with more Crssbow skills, those melee kick skills are left unused for way too long.\n\nSuggestion 2: Archer PVE improvement ideas\nDetails:\nArcher PVE requires high apm to compete with other but classes that is ok. But it becomes and issue when along with the high apm requirement class is also very squishy , making it even harder at high gear score PVE spots. Even with recommended DP Archer feels very squishy at most spots. This is not fair to the class and this force new players to move away from the class. My one and only suggestion to improve PVE would be:- Give Archer DP buff on skills to deal with being too squishy in PVE"

        "content": "Family name: Strahilles\nRegion: EU\nClass: 1) Pre-awakening and 2) Awakening Warrior\nSuggestion for 1): Preawakening skills adjustments and minor Awakening changes.\nDetails: First I want to talk about the pre-awakening. Making levelling a warrior more enjoyable between level 50-55. Because pre-awakening there are limited effective skills to pve with to 56.\nThose are:\n- Spinning Slash\n- Scars of Dusk\n- Ground Smash\nThese three are the only reliable damaging skills before awakening is reached and this makes levelling a warrior to 56 a boring experience. One time I've decided to level up a warrior again, to see how the class had been changed. There was a noticable increase in efficiency compared to what I had experienced at late 2017, but not enough.\nUltimate Ground Smash skill costs way too much(44 skill points) to make any use of it. The skill is good, but the cost is what it lets it down and the level from which it can be learned(at 55). It should be around 30-35 skill points and could be learned from level 52 or 53.\nForward Slash is a skill to replenish WP. It's pre-awakening damage is too low. A little increase to it's pre-awakening ranks would be suitable for it.\nSpinning Counter is a low damage skill. Maybe it's a good idea to increase it's damage and to be learned at different(later) levels on each rank.\nFrenzied dash: I tried to put this skill to use not only once. But for some reason this skill's damage was lacking for it's skill points cost and because pre-awakening skill points were limited I just decided to put them elsewhere. Perhaps the numbers on it were incorrect. I don't know.\nGuard: This isn't a really big deal, but it baffles me personally. Unlike other classes(ex. Valkyrie or Nova) wearing weapon and shield warrior can't move to sideways, without getting out of shield block. And on top of that it consumes stamina, while moving with Guard on to the front or back. Why is this a thing? It shouldn't cost stamina, nor he should leave shield block stance, while moving.\n\nSuggestion for 2):\nAwakening warrior is awell rounded class. However I still find several awakening skills very weak.\nFrenzied Strikes: This skill is slow with no protection, unless one chooses to pick it's core skill(adding a FG) and it's damage in pve isn't something to be admired. It's use is to get it's crit damage short buff and cancel it. It's PvE damage should be increased and to have a FG, but also decrease it's damage it can do in PvP at the same time.\nFlow: Hilt Strike: This skill's damage is just tickling everything. If it doesn't do damage, maybe a temporary buff could be added like Attack speed boost for 5 seconds. Or some other type of utility.\nKnee Kick: Another low damage and also very short range skill. In most cases it's risky to use. Perhaps an improved utility on this skill can make it more rewarding. I personally don't have any idea about it yet.\nFlow: Reckless Blow: Don't get me wrong. This skill is actually a good skill. However it's cooldown is long - 10 seconds. Perhaps it should be 9 or 8 seconds. I just run out of awakening skills to use in PvE.\n\nP.S. In case I get any better ideas about anything or I want to add something I will edit my post instead of needlessly flooding suggestions in several posts. Maybe even scratch something from the mentioned above. All these ideas aren't final."

So to implement a way for an Awakening Maehwa to have some counterplay is to make Sleet Step an iframe when it's off cooldown. Awakening has damage and protections so these were never really the main problem. Succession on the other hand does need some quality of life changes. Some time ago, there was a patch which made Prime: Blind Slash consume WP rather than stamina. This was a fantastic change as it was a way to combat the specs stamina heavy kit. The only thing I would say that would be a nice addition is to make Prime: Whirlwind Cut able to regen stamina while lingering the Super Armor, the skill has a heavy stamina cost on top of the already stamina heavy kit, so being able to have another skill to regen would be very fair along with adding FG on Prime: Blooming as it is our one of few hard hitting abilities. Lastly, this may be controversial, but I would like to see Stigma in both succession and awakening to be a full Super Armor only because the duration of the protection is rather short and the beginning and the end there are large gaps in which we can be cc'd."

Keep in mind this is an all-or-nothing post, the changes I am proposing would work together but wouldn’t work at all separately. I am saying this as a Sorceress PVP player veteran that knows more about the class than anyone in the balance team.\n\nIframe nerf:\nNight Crow cooldown 0s->1s.\nMake a Prime: Night Crow with 0s cooldown so that Succession Sorceress stays the same.\n\nCompensation so the class stays playable and still flows correctly:\n1- New skill in the Awakening skill tree: Flow:Storming Crow. Replaces pre-awakening Storming Crow's Superarmor with an IFRAME and 3 seconds Cooldown.\n\n2- Allow Shadow Leap to be used from pre-awakening (Amulet).\n\n3- Allow Dark Backstep to be used from Quick Slot and from Awakening (Scythe).\n\n4- Make Wing of the Crow Superarmor instead of Forward Guard.\n\n5- Allow Grim Reaper’s Judgement to be used from Amulet with RMB+C, which currently uses Cartian’s Protection, an unnecessary transition.\n\n6- Make an awakening Flow: Crow Food that uses Shard of Darkness x1 to use Flow: Night Crow if you don't have enough stamina.\n\n7- Remove Stiff and Float from Flow: Vile Plan and add Forward Guard.\n\n8- Remove the Explosion Attack Hits of Shadow Ignition, remove the Air Smash and shorten the skill considerably. Allow it to be canceled by S+C (Cartian’s Protection).\n\nEngagement buffs:\n1- Make the extra attack hit of Soul Harvest a Grapple that floats, with Superarmor on grapple like every other class.\n\n2- Nightmare rework:\nRemove the Stiffness from the skill entirely but keep the Knockback.\nSpeed up the start-up and behind-enemy attack by 50%.\nMake the behind-enemy attack cancel Soul Harvest into its extra attack hit.\nFix the bug that makes the Iframe sometimes not work correctly during the last 2 seconds of Nightmare.\n\nMobility buffs:\n1- Remove the Stamina cost from Violation Off-cooldown (300->0), and make it 400 during cooldown (300->400).\n\n2- When Night Crow is used forwards with WW, the distance traveled should be increased by ~1.5 to 2 times. Side and backwards Night Crow stays the same.\n\n3- Remove the collision from Shadow Leap. Currently, going through targets reduces the distance traveled.\n\nQOL Buffs:\n1- Remove the Air Smash from Darkness Released.\n\n2- Add a Casting Speed debuff to Engulfing Shadow (Attack speed -15% -> Attack speed & Casting speed -15%).\n\n3- Add 10 Base AP to the class so we can compete in Arena of Solare damage-wise.\n\n4- Change our Stamina passive for Casting speed or AP, for the same reason as the above.\n\n5- Change Grim Reaper's (E buff) Evasion +15% and All Resistance +30% to Casting Speed +20% and All AP+20\n\nA few of these buffs will transfer to Succession Sorceress which is also a class that needs help and currently needs some mobility help.\nAgain, this is ALL OR NOTHING (except for the QOL buffs). If the nerf is adopted, then all of the buffs must also be or the class will become completely unplayable. And do not try to adopt this nerf while changing stuff all around from what I proposed, again, it will most likely not work."

I think the class is fine, In open world and seige the class is ok at best, BOTTLEG musa or ninja. but im all for handouts, give my class some of the succession DK love :). The real issue that needs to be addressed is fixing server desync and visual desync. And In my opinion mouse move is one of the contributors to desync. Zerkers can fly and do 180s mid air and land on you and grab you, warriors can spin 360 degrees with their 100% bsr and hit u even if they miss the stab. Make these skill that can be mouse move more like drakonia skills, where you can still control them with camera flicks and movement but not these sharp turns that defies the laws of physics.Render range charge is also a big problem, a lot of times warriors can just hover barely outside render range, and rush up super quick and catch people off guard due them suddenly appearing on top of you, maybe nerf some distance of certain skills in exchange for protection. I know Warrior personally but I also know there are other classes that can do the same thing, be it different ways.But overall I think awakening warrior is still VERY GOOD as a offensive playmaker in 1 v 1 and small scale fights, however its defence is not as good as the other SA block classes like valk with its heals/Protected area, or guardian with their long distance protected skills to escape a fight, hence it is not a favored class for large scale. I personally call it a bootleg musa or ninja when I play it in siege."

In Arena of Solare damage overall is considerably lower than other forms of PvP, so bleeds such as Succession Ninja's class buff give an insane amount of potential to win games outright from the pressure gained by said debuffs. More often then not if you are hovering near 600HP or even lower you will die in your Emergency Escape (V) 100% of the time just from bleeds alone. It's the most oppressive skill in Arena of Solare currently that will win rounds just by having it up. The spec already has exeptional damage in Arena of Solare not considering its class buff, so why give a class that excells at damage, protection, and ability to pressure, something that outright makes it broken? In contrast, the Awakening spec of Ninja has sub-par and at times quite literally unplayable damage that kills nothing (bias opinion of course but its true). https://gfycat.com/cookedrequiredbellsnake\n\nThe main point is that the class will still be a top 3-5 AoS class even without its broken class buff, so I suggest to completely gut or rework the ebuff around something that doesnt make it insanely oppresive in AoS."

Allow us to instant cast it without waiting.\n\n(Touch of Exploitation) massively increase PvE damage of this skill, increase the attack animation of this skill it's too long it's useless for PvE and PvP atm.\n\n(Spirit Blaze) increase the accuracy from 5% to 25%( same as the Pre-awakening Enforcement), and Increase the range, hitbox, attack speed, and damage on this skill atm this skill is so bad we barely even use it in PvE because of how bad the hitbox is and slow the skill is. this skill should be a high-risk high reward skill since it's a melee skill on a squishy class like Dark Knight it should do a considerate amount of damage something like Enforcement type of damage it has no protection unless you run the Core skill that nobody does and the CC is not instant.\n\n(Spirit Blaze Flow)increase the accuracy from 5% to 25%(same as the pre-awakening Flow Termination), and Increase the range, hitbox, attack speed, and damage on this skill. Remove the useless down smash, add Super Armor and give back the Knockdown like the old version then Awakening Dark Knight can be more useful for game modes like the Arena of Solare with it.\n\n(Shattering Darkness) Change the Magic Attack Damage from 801%x1, max 11 hits to 801%x11 helps PvP and PvE.\n\n(Flow: Bombardment) Change the Magic Attack Damage from 771%x1, max 11 hits to 771%x11 helps PvP and PvE.\n\n(Flow: Darkness Outpouring) Allow us to use it from more skills so we can outplay the enemy more and be more unpredictable with our catches it's not a protected high-risk high reward skill.\n\n(Spirit Hunt) increase the animation speed of the skill, increase the attack distance and increase the hitbox. remove stamina consumption and add +15AP for 5 seconds something similar to the pre-awakening F skill.\n\n(Flow: Root of Catastrophe) Match the cooldown of the counterpart skill from 8.5 to 8 seconds Remove Super Armor its a range skill it doesn't need it. Since it will have no Super Armor nor CC increase the damage on this skill for PvP.\n\n(Spirit Legacy) Reduce the cooldown from 11 to 8 seconds this will massively help her PvP because she has issues where once her skill all goes on Cooldown she has no good filler damage and as for PvE same issue.\n\n(Trap of Vedir) The skill has an identity issue, is it used for evasion debuffing or it is used for running away Defensively? Remove the Evasion Debuff and bring back the original Trap of Vedir with the big AOE with the Stun CC. Also fix the Foward Guard gap it has at the very end.\n\n(Cluster of Despair) Increase the range of the skill, remove the Super Armor, and allow the skill to be moved with camera movement like the first version of it from global labs that was much better than this. Decrease the -25% movement speed to -15% and add -15% attack and casting speed. this change makes it a high-risk high reward skill since you can cancel it with Dusk iframe anyways.\n\n(Grip of Grudge) Add 50% crit rate in PvP and add 9% evasion debuff on it, this skill suits the role well for debuffing since it has a low cooldown big AOE and it flows well with certain skills for a potential combo.\n\n(Soul Snatch) Increase the range of this skill by x2.5 times making it a ranged skill, make the attack instant increase the AOE hitbox, and add a 20% guard break currently, Awakening Dark Knight has no such mechanics.\n\n(Dark Nebula) Reduce the damage when used as a cancel with other skills and increase the damage when used as a full stand-alone skill that much much more sense.\n\n(Core: Touch of Exploitation) Remove the bound and change it to Knockdown so it's more attractive as a choice.\n\n(Core: Spirit Legacy) Change it to stun on hits even if the skill is on cooldown giving Dark Knight a choice for being a CC bot for the team.\n\n(Core: Seed of Catastrophe) Remove super armor and change the core skill to Flow: Root of Catastrophe giving it a Float instead.\n\n\nPlease fix this already what am I supposed to do as a Dark Knight if I fight Striker, Mystic, and Succ nova I lose by default I do 0 damage.\nMake every class modifier at least 94.16% and reduce the Dark Knight vs Dark Knight to 94.16%. I remember you guys had patch notes on global lab stating that you will consider changing Dark Knights class vs class modifiers but afterward never talked about it ever again.. no matter how much you buff Dark Knight it will never be satisfying to play her until this is addressed"

Prime: Scars of Dusk would be the first choice, the skill is underwhelming as it is, instead of being the Signature Skill of Succ Warrior.-T3 Addons: The specc has its T3 Addons on movement skills, no one literally use them because it's unthinkable to use a movement skill in a PvP Combo. Changing T3 Addons would be another small but effectful change. Ideas for T3 Addons would be Prime: Ground Smash, Prime: Scars of Dusk or such.-Other Important Changes:-Prime: Shield Strike: Remove the first two Hits Animation from the skill and keep the Third hit to activate as a Flow, the same as it is now. Literally the main complain about this skill is the first two hits, they get triggered while using other skills with the same Key Input (RMB).-Prime: Take Down: Our Prime Grab was Tested and seemingly the extra ignore grab resistance doesnt work, either test and fix this or introduce a new Prime Skill instead of this one.-Short Distance Movement: Succ Warrior has good long distance movement, but lacks the small distance ones, resulting in becoming a turtle at times, introducing one or two prime skills from the already existing skill set would benefit alot, Ideas: Upper Shield Strike: Increase the starting animation speed and just a bit the distance covered.-Smoother transition between Skills: We have to almost always resort to wasting our only Iframe to Cancel some Skills, would be nice to instead having skills connect to each other (or atleast to Prime: Solar Flare.) more smoothly, like smoother Solar Flare into Shield Charge,  Solar Flare into Chopping Kick.-E Buff: Our E Buff is not useful as it is right now, the DP buff doesn't stack with our Block Buff, Evasion is useless on Warrior, Movement speed is useless on Succ Warrior cuz 99% of time we use Attack Speed, and the resistance is also kinda useless, only thing useful is the Accuracy, so please the E Buff needs some tweaks.There would be more to cover but those IMO are some of the most important ones o/"

They are way too good for the current meta. Gearing to be tanky in the current meta outside of 1v1 is impossible unless you take an unreasonable amount of damage loss and only works on gauntlets. The fact that you can go full accuracy accessories and still be able to do more than enough damage to DR players makes no sense. We are at a point where people get killed standing up without the need of ccs.\n2. The low respawn timer in siege needs to be addressed. There is no reason being tanky or even having a proper frontline in siege. Just go full damage and respawn in 3 seconds. (100 ranger/witch/wizard/awk zerker/archer will plow through everything)\n3. Make V be usable in any situation and cleanse all DOTs when it is used. Also fix various features where you can be stuck in V like Zerkers grab or Novas Vacuum (not sure if that one was fixed already).\n\nSuccession Lahn:\nThe main reason succession lahn works is because of human damage crystals. Quite honestly succession lahns base damage without those crystals is bad. They are the difference between one skilling people with kick or doing just one third of the hp bar. Blooming Nether Flower needs a buff when you hit multiple people. It just does not do damage that way. I dont know what it is, probably some sort of split damage, if that is the case it needs to be removed.\n\nAwakened Lahn:\nWhere to begin I am already out of breath. Let me quickly s-block and rotate a few SA abilities for a good 10 seconds before i can think about doing something again. Why would and reasonable person honestly play this over musa. Most of the kit is either unprotected or FG, which works for 1v1 but any scenario other than that its kind of a gamble. I will take the 50/50 on deadly dance. Why would somebody play this over DK? Lahns damage is mediocre at best. DK does what Lahn does better. You do not even need a grab when you kill people standing and take a gamble whether or not that person is gonna i-frame it or wait for an animation locked skill. DK with a pegasus is a better Lahn. Plain and simple. Oh yeah and its way better protected. It feels like playing the game with an outdated design that is still being held to a standard where the class was good."

Give it more damage so it becomes actually painful to fight next to one At the moment the skill does really low damage to the enemy unless they inside the ball for the whole duration, which basicly never  happens coz the Ball is moving and you can just walk out of the succ, could just lower the pvp reduction from 70% to 50/40% to make this happen\n\n2. Give it its succ back so its an actually utility ultimate again ( leave the dmg as it is)\nThere are several normal skills from other classes which outshines the succ of the Black Spirit: Cartian's Protection by alot even those its a 100% Rage ultimate of the classI think a utility ult is very awesome to have and it would make using it more viable than it is now, just revert the succ change from back then\n3. Give it a big slow which the Orb attacks apply in pulses around it\nAnother option would be to give it a -30% all slow that debuffs on the pulse damage of the orb attacks Which would make it again an utility ult with low dmg but still be useful in nws etc\n\n\nOver all i think the Black Spirit: Cartian's Protection should stay an utility ultimate and not a black hole of death because it would be more team oriented which is something sorc as a class lacks since the nerf of it  some years ago"

The range and amount of Shai heals becomes insignificant.\n@ It is necessary to change the SHIFT+E healing to percentage, for example, 20% per tick (60% total). These are fair numbers for that small area of effect, unprotected casting and a cooldown of 1 min 30 sec. Level 58 rabam heal can simply be increased from 1000 to 1500 and made self applicable.\n\n#2 (W+RMB) Skateboard doesn't give escape, doesn't give initiation. Breaking into battle on a skateboard, when classes have control on almost every skill, will not work.\n@ PLS add superarmor at the beginning and at the end. Also Shai needs grab resistance or damage reduction passive.\n\n#3 The \"Q\" talent debuff, which can be cast now once every 3 minutes, can simply be avoided by invulnerability and blocks. Same thing with the \"SHIFT+Q\".\n@ Devs can make it an aura-based debuffs around the Shai for at least 5 seconds applying a 20-30 seconds debuff.\n\n#4 In general, Shai has a very small set of skills, the AOE of the main skills is still inconvenient and they have no PVP control except for one RMB-stun and one stun with LMB + RMB. Forest's echo is very weak nowadays due to the very large amount of defensive movement on all classes. Other classes can have up to 15+ skills with controls in one stance. Why can't the support class catch the enemy so that the team can damage him?\n@ Add one skill with knockdown + Superarmor, albeit with a long cast time, it will already be many times better than coming close for a \"F\" kick.\n\n#5 In the current realities, all classes have high crit chances, so the Z-buff gives very little bonus to most of allied classes.@ It would be nice to change it to critical damage buff instead of crit chance.\n\n#6 Shai still doesn't have Tier-3 addons like -20 defence.\n@I don't see any problem adding them.\n\n#7 In the Arena of Solare, Sol has a TET grade, which can be considered simply a humiliation of the hero. It doesn't work like that, the effectiveness of my abilities depends on it. In my team, only 3 people get buffs instead of 10 on the siege, why should my buffs also be cut?\n@Can we get a pen?,\nThe Developers say that Shai is a unique class, so please keep it in mind when changing the balance and introducing new content. \"Unique\" does not mean that it can be released and forgotten."

Improvements made to Storming Star would allow Nova to loop back damage allowing commands to be chained together better, improving overall PvE damage. There are several ways of doing this, one would be to make a Prime version of the skill that interacts with pawns and Axian, benefitting from previous summon damage buffs. The other is using Serpent's Coil from awakening Hashashin as framework (1690x1, max 24 hits. Last hit damage: 1690x3) to improve its damage (currently 1050x1, max 12 hits. Last hit damage: 1050x5).

Simply because it is a long animation, locked in place, unprotected, unfavourable CC, mediocre damage, and no cancel except danse macabre which we need for movement & to cancel lunatic discuss. It's a shame because the skill is one of kuno's loveliest looking abilities. Now I definitely do not want to suggest adding more protection to awakening, or the game for that matter so here's how to fix it:\n1. Change stamina consumption to WP consumption. (it's not even a movement skill)\n2. Allow us to cancel the skill with more awakening abilities and/or ghost step.\n3. Allow the skill effects and animation to continue even after the skill is cancelled. (a bit like delighted blast, but since the CC is only applied at the start it won't be an op mechanic.)\n4? Possibly change key input from F because it's very easy to missclick, also disable the use of the skill whilst in the cooldown period.\n\n\n\nBoth Flow: Wrath and Flow: Indignation are very limited with their number of inputs. Allow us to flow with them after using more awakening abilities such as:\n1. Add LMB inputs for Flow: Wrath after using Moon Storm, Halfmoon and Halo.\n2. Add RMB inputs for Flow: Indignation after using Moon Storm, Halfmoon and Halo.\n\n\nLastly, Buff PvE DMG.

        "content": "Family Name:AlistairRegion (NA/EU):NAClass (Awakening/Succession):Succession Warrior Suggestion:Further Revamps of our ablities and pvp buffsDetails:Hello and thank you for reading this here is my suggestion. Succession Warrior feels like a spec that is ether forgotten by  Pearl Abyss on the PC side at least as I am also a BDO mobile player and will also be using that for some of my suggestions towards what I think the class should get buffed. First and formost I think Succession Warrior ability to pvp  should be looked at. Succession Warrior main weakness is the lack of accuracy which is just a warrior problem as a whole but awakened warrior has it a little better. Some of our hardest hitting moves like scars of dusk does no damage to evasion classes due to the fact it can`t hit them. Along with the fact that Succession Warrior has a massive damage issue which AOS as brought to light. Compared to our awakaned counter part. Another issue is our slow animations which in pve thats fine but in pvp when you have everyone blinking around like its dragon ball z you get lucky  if  you land a cc on someone or a grab. Our strongest cc Spin counter is a frontal guard which due to desync at least in NA fronal guards are a myth dude to the amount of block jumps (skills that instant put you behind somone) or skills you put in the game that are coded as hitting from above not in front even though your stareing at the person so you still get hit. We have no way of dealing with people frontal guard easily besides grab or wasting our iframe which you have on a werid cool down time for some reason. Another thing  that needs to be revamped or make no sense is our Prime guard and Prime take down. I feel like Prime Guard needs to be buffed as some succession warrior mains I spoke to feel like it now needs a tiny tweak mostly when you have some classes who get 50dp  on Q block like Succession Nova. Instead of giving it 20dp plus 5 extra dp the more you get hit which becomes a max of 50 dp which give you a 70 dp buff ( actually DR) why not just automatically just give the succession warrior 70dp in guard stance or make it where the  20 second guard stance the 20 dp one gets buffed to 70 dp instead if  there being a second buff that increases our dp but only for 5 seconds just combine the two. As for Prime take down I think you should make it like how it used to be the double take down in the early days of bdo before awakaneing as it would help lock people down and give it the a different way of sticking out since you took away the SA on the grab. Finally allow succession warrior and only succession warrior to walk side ways while Q blocking and revamp prime scars of dusk animation and prime evasion animation . In BDO mobile Succession Warrior can walk sideways while in guard stance and their scars of dusk animation comes out quickly and is just one big slash which has a cc put on top of it along with having a back dash animation for their I frame which we know you can put in the game because you copied stuff like shai skateboard which was on bdo mobile first and put it on PC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1sMKDBTmQ Here as example of what succession warrior ( Gladiator its called on mobile) looks like on mobile in terms of the animations and stuff I was talking about. I`m not saying making it a copy and past of BDO mobile warrior as clearly mobile is a different game but what I am saying Succession Warrior mobile has gotten more love and respect and patches and buffs and nerfs then its pc counterpart. To the point the pc counter part feels like a bootleg wish.com version at times at least in pvp thank you for reading and have a nice day."

In my opinion the skill isn't actually bad at all and can be used in between Gale/Blooming combo but due to the cooldown existence if 4 seconds and longer execution it should have added Forward Guard on 1st hit at least to make it more attractive to pick over absolute version and have some PvP usability. \n_____________________\nLastest nerfs to Musa Succession damage output on Gale, Cyclon and Blooming might be understandable due to ability of spamming them like crazy, especially Prime Gale but i think Succession Musa falls behind with amount of protection on his other minor skills that apply Serene Mind buff like above Prime Divider (Absolute version should be still unprotected imo), also Prime Blind Slash being yet another unprotected minor skill in his kit could have better PvP potential if protected. If they justify decrease of Musa Succession damage to push us to rotate more skills in between Gale/Blooming then make other minor skills aside from Dragon Bite more attractive to use.\n______________________________\nLunar Slash and Dragon Claw in both Awa/Succ are skills i bet every Musa is blocking. They have no protection, no debuffs, self buff, nothing that would make them useful in any way due to again, long execution, no combo and lack of protection. Those two could also use a small \"reboot\". Not sure what yet but they are just two useless skills.\n__________________________________\nSo all in all, add Forward Guard to Prime Divider, add some protection to Prime Blind Slash, give Lunar Slash and Dragon Claw a rework.\n\nThank You."

Remove the need to have an ap buff to use the skill in awakening. To use arid assault in awakening you would need either to shift+f in pre-awakening, piercing fang after a skill, z-buff, or class buff. It's a nuisance as well because it just consumes your ap buff anyway. I'm essentially using the buff to use the skill so the buff can be taken away. Why even make me buff at all? Just let me use it like succ does. https://streamable.com/rl6mvphourglass: This skill is absolutely useless lmao. I have never seen anyone use this for any application in pvp at all. The range to teleport back is trash I could dash away from the tornado twice and be out of range. Why even use this skill if I can just dash away like normal anyway? If you actually wanted to buff this skill and make people use it you would make the range global and remove the stamina cost while also increasing the cooldown to like 90 seconds to compensate.weapon sheathing: more of a bug really and this applies to all classes not just hash, though it feels like it occurs to hash the most, but when the player gets up after being cced they do not have their weapons out and are left in a defenseless state. Not much to say there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-NxPQNb4icalso buff both specs hp and mp sustain in pve"

Moreover, the link between the skills only actionable while in the air are difficult and borderline punishing to do during combat. Add to this that the skills in question; Ground Thrust, Flow:Kick Down and airborne Shuriken Throw do not offer much value as they are, I suggest a change.\n\n\n\n1. Transition into the Air: Boss Slaughter has a leap animation into the air which could be utilised to link into the airborne skills. Block Jump could also have an additional key input (f) to teleport into the air from which the airborne skills could be used.\n\n\n2. PvE Damage: Increasing the damage of Ground Thrust & and Shuriken Throw significantly in my opinion would feel more rewarding given the set-up requirements. The aoe and damage of Flow: Kick Down would also need to be dramatically increased to be a worthwhile PvE skill. (Keep the cc range narrow)\n\n\n3. Awakening Kit: The awakening kit itself I believe would benefit from a fast, large aoe skill, with high damage in PvE specifically. Minor PvP adjustments I would suggest are Silent Charge protection gap reduced, and an option to cancel the end of Flashing Light to remain mobile.\n\n\n4. SA Trade Alternative: Would love to see a fully charged Drastic Measure turn into a projectile.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading ✌️"

As a main Lahn, I really like playing as Awakening, but flying is so fun :) and due to this skill being limited to Succession Lahn only, I keep switching from Awakening to Succession all the time to be able to enjoy this skill while I'm grinding mobs. If this skill was available to Awakening Lahns, we could chose the style we want to play (Awakening/Succession) and still have the most fun we can get flying. Skill usage would be exactly as in Succession mode. If this triggers any concerns to PVP, there could be a debuff in Awakening mode as the main idea would be just for PVE/fun."

Tackling rock change in stamina usage was a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough since everything else regens stamina and doesn't particularly cost anything. \n\nLava Piercer & Prime: Lava Piercer: add x stam cost upon activation, and don't regen stamina while active OR have the skills drain stamina over time while active, similar to holding a charged skill on another class. Second option allows for instantly cancelling into predatory hunt or tackling rock for burst movement but would impact how long we linger SA in our rotation continuously without forcing ourselves to stay somewhat stationary. NOTE: THIS SHOULD ONLY BE FOR SUCCESSION, NOT AWAKENING. Regular lava piercer should have the additional effect of this stamina consumption, like Absolute: Weakling Hunt becomes Succession version upon learning.\n\nPrime: Predatory Hunt: add x stamina cost to activate the skill, no stamina regen. \n\nThese changes would mean the class can't continuously loop between tackling rock, lava piercer & predatory hunt for movement, but don't force it in a wheelchair. We still regen plenty of stam in Prime: Devastation, Prime: Fearsome Tyrant & Prime: Fierce Strike. I personally believe the current state of the game with many classes being able to constantly stay SA 24/7 without draining some form of resource continuously is unhealthy, and for this to change zerker must change too. I'd like to see the skill floor raised so that there is some depth to the spec.\n\nGrab Locks: our ability to extend our grabs even without slows is a massive strength in content like Arena of Solare, but in general is just an unnecessary part of our kit that if removed would only leave the game better off. If a grabbed target uses Emergency Escape (V), we should be forced to end our grabs as soon as possible (as if we were to input lmb during Rock Smash or Smack Down). I do not agree with the idea of cancelling our grab, and forcing us into a half second uncancellable and unprotected animation as it would just mean whenever we catch someone in group content, we ALSO get caught. If needed, let the player in their Emergency Escape move immediately upon activation however keep us in the ending of our grab animations to not immediately animation lock us.\n\nWeakling Hunt: super simple change - make it so that the +15dp selfbuff has to proc upon hitting a target, as the cooldown is lower than its duration and is a contributing factor to why succession feels so tanky in capped content like Arena of Solare.\n\nIF stamina & mobility nerfs go through (which I hope they will) I'd also like to see some form of new skill added, as a good few of our mainhand skills are just utility/heals rather than damage skills. Berserker succession suffers from not having great options for trading outside of spamming Prime: Predatory Hunt & Prime: Ancient Wave, as Fearsome Tyrant has too long of a cooldown, Raging Thunder locks you into animation and has an awkward ending, and Devastation has a fairly low damage output. Succession form of Slugfest would be nice, just some form of stationary, cancellable trading tool.\n\nAlso buff our WP meter lol."

Blade Dance having a down attack modifier would give her another decent filler damage skill to use in her combo aside from Blooming Nether Flower (which does mediocre damage but that's fine because it is SA from start to finish). As it stands you really only have Blooming as your only real down attack skill to use after a CC since literally everything else you use that has worthwhile damage (Cymbidium, Pendulum Kick, Salp'uri) has a CC tied to it so you are forced to hold off on using those skills at times to avoid hitting the CC cap early so your options for damage during CCs are very restrictive. Pendulum Kick has a clunky issue where you have a slight animation lock after finishing the 3rd kick, this skill has backloaded damage so it feels weird to have it animation lock you like that when it's already a commitment to hold the skill for that long to get your damage off, you can animation cancel out of it real fast after the 1st & 2nd hit so I don't see a reason why you can't for the 3rd hit. This would also help in combo damage without changing her PvP % numbers since it would allow a little bit of extra time for any filler damage skills, alternatively it could be changed so that this skill links into things like Cymbidium/Blooming smoothly. Right now this skill just feels awkward to press and I'd just like for it to be somewhat smoothed out to match the other animation changes she received in the rework. \n\n\n--\nStreamable Link below to showcase the 1st/2nd Hit Cancels and the 3rd kick's slight animation lock.\nhttps://streamable.com/gq6vfk"

Make one of the unused awakening maehwa skills a superarmor to help with stamina management mid combat.Currently Tenacious Edge is a skill that has no purpose in the awakening kit , it deals zero damage , locks u in place , the cc is not viable and the core of the skill adds a frontal guard.\n\nMaking this skill a superarmor without the cc on it with the cooldown that it has ( 3 seconds) would make it a purely stam regen standing still skill that is punishable due to its long animation and the fact it deals absolutely zero damage.\n\nTLDR:\n1) Frostfeint iframe ( iframe on backwards movement)  OR  Sleet step into an iframe with a lower cd 7sec -> 4sec with reduced stam cost\n2) Tenacious Edge into superarmor without the cc for stam regen purposesWhat to take away from my class?1.) I think reducing the accuracy self buff from 15% to 9% to bring it in line with other classes acc selfbuffs.2.)Reduce evasion shred on moornise from -9% to -6% for the same reason as above.\n\nOverall pvp changes I´d Like to see. 1.)No resistances in pvp due to its rng nature and unrewarding feeling2.)V being able to be used at all times \n3.)Adjustments of slows and how easily applicable they are on certain classes\n4,)Grab cc counting as a 2.0 hard cc aka you cannot follow up after a grab cc with another cc OR equalize the range of grabs to be short ranged/ make it more forgiving to use itDue to grabs being really strong and hard to balance because even after the initial grab cd nerfs , they are still the number 1 tool to cc people , make it so that Grab cc counts as a 2.0 hard cc , which means you cannot follow up on a grab cc with another cc to combo into and its purely just used to counter superarmor rotating classes while also not making it an insta win tool while ignoring literally the whole kit of another class. If thats too big of a nerf , id want to see atleast the grabs being more punishing to use or harder to land with lowered range/aoe"

For succ staff however, the duration of lighting skills slow is small, so its fine, the class itself shouldnt have that many slows though, it is already ranged, very protected and really nimble, the ammount of slows it has allows no counterplay for slower classes that will just get outpressured by the succ staff easily enough.\n\n\nbut how do u kill rats without slowing them(sorc for instance is almost unatchable without some slow on them)? they tend to be hard to pin down even with max slow value on them tbh. :D altho i do agree protected slows like gravedigging(fixed) and devastation and BON furor are a bit overkill, also succ prime lightning spells with protection and guardian passive and similar stuff. \n\nalso, slow addons shouldnt be allowed on already slowing skills imho."

Our team will be monitoring this thread daily to ensure all relevant feedback is collected and sent to the developers.\n \nWe ask that you provide your suggestions using the following template:\n\n\nFamily Name:Region (NA/EU):Class (Awakening/Succession):Suggestion:Details:\nPlease limit the suggestion to a single skill or topic, but feel free to post multiple suggestions! Suggestions concerning broader topics should include specific details on improvements. When sending your feedback, please be as detailed as possible. Media such as video and screenshots are also encouraged!\n \nComments that do not follow the template above will be deleted as the purpose of this post is to organize and collect your feedback. If you would like to discuss your class with your fellow adventurers, please make a separate discussion post in this Class Discussion Board and include the relevant class hashtags!\n \nExample of good feedback:\nFamily Name: [CM]VedirRegion: NAClass: Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: Dark Knight PvE Improvement IdeasDetails: Succession Dark Knight is underperforming in PvE, mainly at high end monster zones like Elvia Calpheon. Please increase her damage by increasing the critical hit chance of Absolute: Corrupt Ground from 50% to 100% in PvE. Her sustain could also be improved so I suggest increasing the HP and MP recovery from 40 to 50 and add an 40 HP recovery per hit effect to Absolute: Flow Ravage Rake. These improvements to her sustain skills will help with making her grinding more manageable at high end monster zones.\nExample of bad feedback:\n\nFamily Name: [CM]VedirRegion: NAClass: Dark Knight (Succession)Suggestion: Buff Dark Knight PvEDetails: Buff Dark Knight's damage and lower her cooldowns.\nWe look forward to hearing your wonderful suggestions!\n\n\nFamily Name: SleepNoKamiRegion: euClass: ShaiSuggestion: First of all shais. I really disagree with the recent nerfs the class has recieved, it basically put us back to almost pre-rework levels where the class was struggling at best. Rework gave us a huge boost yet still noone really mained shai, they max tagged it for oluns cause it had strong PVE but that was it. It was defenseless in pvp against any class and our dmg output was mediocre in comparison.BUT we had our PvE. We were excellent grinders even in pvp we were tanky in a DP set and we could debuff the enemy to help our team kill them faster.Now we can only debuff them once every 3 minutes, our skills do basically no dmg and since everyone has higher class dps modifiers against shai now even our (As tanky as u can possible get in this game) gear is useless against a warrior with 1 accuracy accessory. So we are back to defenseless levels.Our main DPS skill has been nerfed, we can no longer debuff each pack and our DPS output is also less. Even the highest geared players no longer clear spots with a weapon while other classes still easily do it.Our skills are unprotected mostly, some well timed frontal guards can save us but if you want to know true suffering then go to sherekans with tuvala gear and watch your character get chain CCd or spend half the time evading the mob CCs for lack of protection. And now what is the class for PA really. It has buffs but they arent that special, every other class has AP and speedspells, our ragebuff is the only unique thing left. So is this what the class is? A glorified buffbot?Every shai main i know tried other classes for seasonal. Most are considering to roll musa or succ zerk or guardian cause its just so much easier to grind with a full SA rota and movement and be able to defend your spot and yourself.You have made our PVE a lot weaker even after multiple promises that u wont nerf classes anymore. U had to take the crown from strikers and u dragged shai into the mud with it simply cause it was good at grinding. But grinding is all we had.I am using my alpaca on my shai now cause its my main but I am losing motivation here...Class: Awakened DrakaniaSuggestion: Some great quality of life changes were made to the class but the main issue is ignored.Playing awa drakania makes pre-awa completely useless and it has become the only class that cannot utilize half its kit because of it. We only got the Rabams and the skill swaps to put us from AWA > PRE and we got NOTHING beside the C swap to put us back in awa.In G-lab we could use the PA skill from awakening but that was removed before release (why?)I suggest u give us either the nova treatment (locking pre-awa movement with instantly use awakening movement skills instead)or give us a few skills that swap the class into awakening.There is so much of the pre-awa kit i want to use but am unable to without using a rabam with gaps or a C swap thats extremely slow.And without being able to use both kits in pvp and pve the class feels half finished. Thank you for reading and considering my reply"

Mystic's kit has very short cooldowns on many of her strong spammable abilities which generate great Spirit Shards: - Prime/Absolute: Soul Basher - Example of an incredibly well made spell both used in PvE and PvP. - Prime/Absolute: Thunder Pound - FG and high damage + evasion debuffing.\n^ this causes no need for the majority of Mystic's kit to ever be used.3. Mystic's [Twisted Collision] and it's [Flow]s are regarded as her only means of aerial movement alongside with [Sea Burial], however they are heavily underperforming on the DPS front.\n - Flow: Landslide is a very cool ability which should be given more attention in PvE at least and looked after properly in terms of SA for PvP.\n\n4. [Sea Burial] is a shard spender that is last on priority in PvE and is even often even avoided unless you're in E/Z buff where your attack speed forces you to generate and use shards on it. - Suggestion: Buff it's Crit Rate and/or 3 Shard Damage in PvE.Thank you for reading and to all other Mystic players for their posts. \n\nWinter is coming... the nerfs are in the furnace... stay strong."

She has huge stamina issues compare to awakening maehwa because succession maehwa skills are cost stamina i really don't get it why... First times succession maehwa was counting as a decent class because at least she had high damage, but in current situation of bdo every class has same even more damage than maehwa and she has nothing left. If you play with succession maehwa you have to go in for kill anyone because because she have no ranged skills beside arrows (which is useless in current bdo)  But unfortunately she can't do this like other melee classes because she has 0 protect even with protected skills are doesn't work properly. She's literally kamikaze class nothing else. Almost all classes are countering succession maehwa easily. She definitely need a huge buff or completely rework or just remove her from the game and give us only awakening opinion which is reverse succession please.\n\nWhat she need? More damage on some skills for example Petal swirl and Redmoon. Remove stamina cost on all skills, less stamina cost on dash, faster dash animation, more protection ( SA for dragon bite, carver and blind slash) Increase skill size of aoe for example to (redmoon, dragon bite) Permanently red blade buff which is good thing. Because getting 3 petals to get red blade buff is kinda annoying. Iframe to frostfeint (stigma) and dragon bite. Decrease cooldown of chase to 1.5 sec. \n\nWhat PA can take from succession maehwa?\n\nNothing because she have nothing left...\n\n\nGeneral suggestion: Decrease all slow debuffs on all classes. Remove grabs on some classes for example Lahn and valkyrie. Remove mouse movement option to fix desync issue to classes which caused e.g ( berserkers and warriors ) Hard nerf for succ mystic, succ/awake dark knight and awake/succ lahn."

Constantly sucking up vacuums to build accel feels like more of a chore than playing the game. Accel received a deserved nerf but with that in mind, it’d be nice if accel wasn’t so boring to build up. My suggestion would be to substantially increase the Star’s Breath from hitting stuff in PVP so you’re rewarded for actually fighting without accel. Alternatively, revert the nerfs to sucking vacuums so we don’t have to suck as many vacuums. Or just give accel a hard cooldown so you don’t have to build Star’s Breath at all. I’m not asking for a buff/nerf, just quality of life."

Speed up the activation speed too as ppl die too fast now for it to have a 2s chargeup animation. Skills like this would help counter the fact that theres too much damage in the game and give her a solid role in group PVP.\n\n\nher class buff(or lack thereof) :\nalot of corsair skills dont scale with AS/MS so replace those stats with something useful, raise the 10ap to atleast 20 as to my knowledge no other class has such low AP on their buff. Stats they could be swapped with include: %acc, %eva, %crit damage(not %crit nearly all the kit is 100% crit), and DP, alot of the reason she's so bad for AoS is because alot of classes have a 3min godmode button while ours only gives 50% resist.\n \n\nyou made an interesting group support spec w/ this class but honestly feels like it wasn't finished as you guys started reworks shortly after class released and then left it in a buggy state for the next year, im at  over100days playtime on my cors and played it since day1 but it has become so dated now that its borderline unusable in most forms of PVP without full DP, and it has only gotten worst as the powercreep increases from buffing already good classes, giving them more protected cc's and leaving us in this buggy state where even our protected skills dont work.\n-\nAlso should be noted the longer these gaps in her protected skills go unfixed, and the more ppl find out about it(~4k views combined on the 3 vids), the less playable the class becomes for the last few ppl on it. I didn't make these clips public for 3-4mo and i only sent them to you to avoid this happening, i only made them public after sending them to you 5x and getting the exact same copy/paste responce(1yr later i still get the exact copy paste reponse as day1)\n-\n\nedit:fixed scuffed formatting best i could, looked much better on wordpad lol"

        "content": "Family Name: Lekrashan\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening Sage\nSuggestion: Stamina Issues, Needs Quick Access to I-Frames, Bugs\nBackground: Awakening Sage has major stamina issues that are hard to compensate with solely through being good on the class. Additionally, I-Frames are hidden behind wind up animations, or using unprotected skills to cancel those animations. Due to this, there is very little counter play to high mobility classes with grabs. \nDetails:\nStamina Suggestions\n>Remove Stamina Lock on Divine Executioner. Additionally, reduce cooldown from 17s to 13-15s range.\nIn Sage's current state, bolt uses stamina, rift chain uses more stamina, overcharged bolt uses more stamina, spear bolt uses stamina, flow:aftershock uses stamina, form shift uses stamina, lightning surge uses stamina. Your options to stay protected after that are skills that put your hands straight above your head, screaming \"Grab me please, I'm out of stamina\". These skills are Ators Energy and Atomagia flow, then Lightning Prison and Rift Storm. These skills lock you in place unless you choose to burn more stamina that you already lack. Finally, you have Divine Executioner and Impaling Flash which both are excellent protected mobility skills. But they both lock your stamina. Being able to utilize Divine Executioner in high pressure situations to stay protected and regain stamina would go a long way for awk sage. \n>Remove the ability to overcharge Bolt when Bolt is not on cooldown\nOvercharged bolt is a fair trade for being able to use the skill on cooldown. You should pay extra stamina for being able to use the skill when it normally isn't available. However, it doesn't seem balanced to suffer the same penalties when the skill isn't on cooldown yet. Currently, you use 50 extra stamina for using bolt whether it's on cooldown or not in the middle of combat due to having to constantly cycle protections. You rarely (if ever) get to utilize the 200 stamina bolt.\n\nQuick Access to I-Frames Suggestions\nCurrently, if you want to recieve the i-frame from bolt, it has to not be on cooldown and you have to use a skill before it which results in being grabbed. All skills that contain an i-frame on it (Spear Bolt/Flow:Aftershock, Divine Executioner, Impaling Flash, and Rift Chain) are restricted by leaving yourself open prior to being able to i-frame. Your choices to get the i-frames on those skills are to (1) perform the 1-2s starting animations (2) Cancel from the ending animation of Rift Storm, a 2 second animation (3) Cancel from shock relay or ator's spear, which are unprotected. Due to this, the only counter play to being grabbed is to get lucky and hope you can queue a skill before the opponent can close the gap on you. In the current meta, too many classes close the gap in less than 20 frames from a 50 unit distance, which is nearly humanly impossible to react and results in 0 counter play and instant grab/death.\n\n>Remove the ability to overcharge Bolt when Bolt is not on cooldown . Move the current I-frame to bolt (when it's used not on cooldown).\nCurrently, you can only access the i-frame on bolt by fullfililng 2 conditions: bolt must not be on cooldown and you have to use any other skill before using bolt. This seems to be a double punishment for properly using a mobility skill that isn't even on cooldown. Not having access to the i-frame from the neutral position results in any class with a grab being able to walk up to you and simply press the grab button with very little counter play due to being restricted to having to use a skill before using bolt. You normally get grabbed while cancelling the skill. If you choose to not get the iframe, it seems your hitbox is still where you started and you warp back into your opponents grab. Removing the overcharge ability from bolt when bolt isn't on cooldown could fix 2 problems in one.\n>Allow Rift Chain to be placed on the hotbar. \nOne viable way to enter rift chain from awakening is by using bolt--rift chain--bolt, which will only exaggerate the previously mentioned stamina issues. Next, you can use void eruption--rift chain. But that is dangerous to use in a pinch and you will get grabbed while in super armor. By placing it on the hotbar, you can go from neutral to I-frame when necessary. \n\nBug Fix\n>There is currently a bug with Spear Bolt and Flow:Aftershock where when used on certain terrain, you teleport into the air, with a 50% chance of landing with your weapon put away. It's incredibly frustrating when it results in me getting knocked down. \n\n>Perhaps it's more desync rather than a bug, but, sage grab being 2 parts often results in me grabbing the air, they resist it, but I'm locked in a long unprotected grab animation as if the grab registered as landing. It never happens on the melee grab, because a resist results in nothing happening as it should. But the ranged grab very often \"Bugs\" and performs full unprotected animations. \n\nConclusion\nI'm convinced the changes above would re-align the class into the current meta,which I would define as high mobility, high burst damage, high protection classes. Awakened Sages mobility is hindered by his constant stamina drain/lock abilities. Awakened Sages damage is hindered by his constant need to choose between either planting his kibelius, raise his hands and get destroyed, or you can choose to run out of stamina until you're S Blocking into a wall begging for team support. Awakened sage, while having many protections, suffers from (1) not having quick access to I frame which results in guaranteed grabs (2) Standing still in super armor which results in being grabbed or destroyed while standing up (3) being block jumped on while in forward guard. So it's not as protected as it would read on paper. Generally, Pvp in environments bigger than 1v1s are incredibly oppressive on this class. \n\nAdditional\nThe above I feel like would most likely fix alot of Sage's current issues. Below, are just some \"Hey, that would be nice to see but it's not high priority\",which is why I don't really break each point down further. \n\nEither\n>Give shock relay back it's forward guard when not on cooldown. \n--Or--\n>Give Lightning Chain a forward guard. \n--Or--\n>Give Lightning Surge a forward guard\n--Or--\n>Improve the flow of Divine Executioner when used during the animation of Flow:Interrogate\n(Obviously it can't have all of those at the same time, but one would be fair) \n\n>Increase the range of Rift Storm.

Past changes to twister in the rework after removal of searing slam (fiery crevice at the time) being spammable was meant to be fixed by making twister consistent damage regardless of CD for pve, although you removed the cancel for crosscut>twister, making it very annoyingly inconsistent to activate twister out of crosscut, the main filler dps you would use as alternative, when you have more attack speed the window to activate twister shrinks. \nAlso possibly adding more damage back to the projection \"blades\" that come from activating skills. This was extremely high on the first glabs update when reworks were announced, it looked insanely strong but there was panic nerfs around it, now it barely equates to a single off cd skill during a combo using it 10+ times per pack, it feels as if it shouldn't be there, just wasted framerate for a skill that does almost no damage in either pvp/pve for something that seemed to be the main 'feature' of the rework"

For a long time awakened lahn was known for only being decent at 1v1, since it lacked protection on its skills, so it was very easy to get cc'd mid-combo in anything but 1v1. PA eventually gave it protection on a lot of its skills which made it viable in more than 1v1s. I'm getting a very similar feeling playing awakened sage. A-Sage has a lot of skills with no protection, or no CC. Removing the forward guard on shock relay made things even worse, since we use that to shorten our long animations (sometimes long unprotected animations). Please consider at least returning the FG on shock relay, or making the slow cast skills the faster versions by default (not including cancels that remove part of the skill)."

Does not really need bigger or even more DMG on AOE to fix/improve.\n\nPvP: Succ combos are strong enough to kill most players so the dmg is there and doesnt really need to be adjusted to fix\n\n[Cons]\nPvE : movement between packs for this class is by  far her biggest issue. There can be alot of down time between packs\n\nPvp: She has very few options to catch her opponents this by far is her major problem not protections as some have suggested. She doesnt need 500 protections but does need a way to catch people. Tamer historically was the trap class but since rework succ has virtually no catches no compensation for it and it shows heavily in smaller scale and 1v1. Large tamer drops off entirely both awk and succ/ This parts due to the lack of protections however giving to many could result in her being EXTREMELY over powered in 1v1 very easily even surpassing warriors potential.\n\n\n\nProposals to Fix the cons.\n\nPve - slightly longer range on her dash / moonlight doing to much though could affect pvp greatly so would need to be proceeded with caution if done especially combined with pvp suggestion below for the skill.\n\n\nPVP: \n\nMoonlight having a protection to allow tamer a bit more manuverability is heavily needed. Succ cant close gap with many classes and this skill is the best way we can but if we do it we just get stunned knocked or punished very easily vs faster classes. Ranged classes show this the most as they can keep kiting forever till u use it to close then stun or kd you and your dead. \n\nCombos could use a bit more protection ( this mainly is how id fix her by adding 1 or 2 sa in her combo so she can actually combo in larger scale with out affecting her 1v1 to much. ) I would suggest having it on lightning of earth  and trample so that they she can get off some of her dmg unpunished . The reason specifically ofr these 2 is most tamers will use it toward the opening of a combo but there easily punished casted most punish it immediately. I am fairly sure having these in SA will not impede 1v1 but would need to see a bit more glabs test with it for further analysis on this as breaking balance is not the point of doing these changes just trying to make her more viable.\n\n\n*fixes*\nThe pet really needs to be fixed cuz still doesnt feel like heliang is doing anything dmg wise despite the \"fixes\" that have previously ben put. Obviously dont wanna see it overly strong but currently it feels like half the time except for e buff and roaring that heliang isnt even there.\n\nVoid with how it currently is can be very hit or miss as well. I seen classes walk right through a void with out sa or anything and never get stiffened and even repeated the test with out any resistance items and they could still do it at times which suggest a potential issue with the skill itself its to the point i feel im forced to use roaring in non dmg scenario as its more consistant then void thus weakinging my combo out put potential with the roaring changes. Awk got this somewhat addressed with howling change but the issue still heavily affects sucession."

Before the Reboot, getting your frontal guard hit while holding S would allow you to quickly react with other skills, but with the changes that have come with the Class Reboot, you are now locked in an animation that drains your stamina whenever your s-block gets hit. This means that there is now a delay between your s-block getting hit and the player being allowed to use an ability to dodge or protect themselves. This may also be an unintended nerf to Sucession Kuno as there have been recent increases in stamina usage but Kuno can no longer rely on s-blocking to recover stamina with a frontal guard, as all it takes is one hit on your frontal guard to put you into an animation that starts drains your stamina."

Shai is the only class in the game that only has access to classic outfits, be that because PA can not or will not produce Artina Sol skins(casting misty haze with marnis guitar could be pretty cool tho.)The result of this is that significantly less Shai outfits are listed on the market when there is a sale the covers both Premium and Classic(for Shai, anyways) outfits.During the last sale(https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Forum/ForumTopic/Detail?_topicNo=23404&_opinionNo=0) using bdolytics.com I was able to compare Shai outfit (hop hop troupe) sales to other classes similarly new outfits over 14 days\n179 vermillion lotus\n172 lunar blue\n33 hop hop troupe classic\nI was able to buy both of the other outfits within a couple of hours on preorder(as there were few to no preorders, due to them filling fast) but kept a preoder on the Shai outfit for the rest of the 2 week sale and never saw it filled along with 50 other pre orders. Because, of course why would people buy Shai outfits to sell when there are over 20 other classes outfits that they can sell for 7% more profit per pearl.ADDITIONALLY\nBecause Shai does not have artina sol skins, nor a succession tree, she is excluded from what is by far the most commonly sold outfit type- Premium Outfix Box, as well as Succession outfit box... as a result Shai players are in a unique position where they only have reliable access to a single outfit type from the central market. We are also uniquely excluded from the crafted Karlstein outfit that we have all been collecting Intricately Patterned Mystical Shards around the world for.(give us the male version imo, no boob window and we would look swag af)Solutions could include: >Increase Classic Outfit Box cost on the CM by 7%>Offer some weird additional 7% discount on Shai Classic outfits>Make Artina Sol slot skins, then give Shai Premium outfit boxes>Add Shai outfits to Premium outfit boxes, but have our outfit boxes include some random awakening slot item that can be resold or cronned>Add Shai to Succession outfit boxes>Reboot Shai and add us to Reboot outfit boxes>Give Shai a Karlstein outfit \"Anyone can be Karlstein\""

Right now i am forced to play awakened wizard because the ONLY 2 other classes i can fully hotbar are female classes Guardian and Witch, Hot barred skills need to chain as quick as non hot barred skills and more classes need to be able to hot bar skills. I would love to play other classes and experience more of BDO but because of hand problems i am forced into 1 of 3 classes out of like 26 which also lowers your income as a company as myself and other don't buy weight and outfits for classes we can't play.\nHonestly if Shai could hot bar its buff skills and use them as quick as key combo'ing them i'd probably main a shai\n\n-Awakened wizard play style does not fit in this games meta like it did years ago, damage is far to high these days for being as stationary as we are and sadly i don't see a way to entirely fix this without changing the class design itself or making it god tier so i'll suggest what i can, i do not think awakened wizard needs a damage buff on a per skills basis but i do think we need mechanic changes and overall damage. We need to be carefull when changing awakened wizard damage though because it can drastically improve our group fighting because were all aoe based.\n\n-People simply walk up to us while we are casting and grab and or nuke us and we can't do much as we are locked into the animation, due to how stationary we are engaging a awakened wizard should come with heavy risks and our damage needs to be increased from class modifer to do this, as awakened wizard is right now our damage is FAR to low for how risky it is for us to be stationary, as i will show a few down on the class to class modifiers our damage is garbage in the back end compared to say sage\n\n-Our pve needs very little, given how big our aoes are i don't think a damage increase is needed, i honestly think as i will mention later a simple change to our barrage of water and magma bomb would be enough.\n\n-Split damage addition to all skills to be modified as needed so we don't 1 shot large groups of people in group fights. If class to class modifiers get added i think split damage may need to be added and increaed on some skills as needed.\n\n-As i said before Awakened wizard does not need damage buffs per skill but i definitly think the class to class modifers need to be adjusted to at least 98-105% to every class, Sage which is the closest to our class in play style does on average 105% to every class in the game so i don't see a problem in us being 98-105% on average\n\nThis is taken directly from global labs so no i didn't fabricate it, you can see all class to class damages here https://www.blackdesertfoundry.com/damage-ratios-by-class-dec-2021/\n\n\nThis is sage who is very similiar to our class in animation cast speed and aoe size and its damage is vastly superior.\n\n\n-It honestly would be nice if our pet damage scaled with our stats more but it should be balanced around class to class modifers if that changes\n\n\nChilling wave is basically useless in pvp because the frontal guard has huge spots where its not protected in front of you, either fix the frontal guard or make the skill a super armor\n\n\n\nHellfire has similiar issues to chilling wave, the class is launched forward but classes just get behind us or slightly to the side and we get knocked down and killed, Hellfire needs its frontal guard fixed or a super armor added\n\n\n\nFlame Calling: lets be honest this skill is literally useless as it does almost no damage and takes forever to activate, just remove it\n\n\n\nBarrage of water, hellfire and Magma Bomb: there is no need for barrage of water to be a 16 second cast time when its a chain skill with hellfire magma bomb and barrage of water,Hellfire is fine as 6 seconds cool down, Magma bomb and barrage of water should be 6 seconds as well as this would greatly help our pvp and pve\n\n\n\nMagma bomb For the love of god make some way to optionally disable Magma bomb from casting after aqua bomb or change the RMB activation to like LMB or something, i can't tell you how many times i have died because it accidently activates after i use aqua bomb. RMB is fine for the Hellfire, magma bomb and barrage of water but magma bomb should be a seperate button after Aqua bomb so you don't accidently use it.\n\n\n\nBolide of destruction should have t3 addons\n\n\n\nHellfire core skill addition to be Super armor\n\n\n\nProtected area- Not really for wiz but i want to say give this to shai as well\n\n\n\nMagical shield- remove the MP eating when were hit to a higher flat mp cost to cast, say 400 or 500, with damage being so high in this games meta were hit once and our mp drops to 0 making this skill virtually useless\n\n\n\n\nTeleport and ultimate-reduce the cool down on this to 4 or 5 seconds for both to to help our pack to pack movement and escape/engage in pvp.\n\n\n\n\nRessurrection: can we actually get this skill to work lol, this is probably the most useless skill in bdo. Resurrection should be a cast animation aoe that revives anyone within X meters of the cast when used, make it unprotected and a 5-10 second cast time and when its finished anyone in range will get a (revive \"yes\" No\") option pop up. Also give this skill to shai as well when fixed.\n\n\n\n\nFlame knot; This is the worst grab in the game........ its is beyond super slow to cast and you need to literally be right on top of someone to use it and i mean kissing their face close. Flame knots animation speed needs to be quicker and the grab range needs to be a bit farther and wider to a frontal cone.\n\n\n\n\nSummon keeper marg: I think the Bolide damage increase should be changed to Hellfire as its used far more often, i have no input on the extra damage it should give just that it should be changed."

Other option are weird too, like moving backward with prime evasive explosion shot (cam lock preferably) etc.In pvp its even worse, with counterpart classes such as archer not only having better mobility in terms of efficiency (distance, protection, smoothness as can be seen in \"skating style\" videos) but also protected cc's while moving. Reporting a few comparison:• Piercing Cry: Super Armor, Stiffness, 3 seconds cooldown similar animation to Ranger Twisting Wind: Super armor, no cc, 4 second cooldown.• Meteor Dive: Super Armor, Stiffness, 5 seconds cooldonw similar animation to Ranger Call from Sky: Super armor, no cc, no cooldown, staggering problems and chains bad with other skills.This are just a few of alot (literally alot) of comparisons that can be made with almost all classes in the game.What to do: • Reduce the cooldown of Twisting Wind, Raiding the Wind, Evasive Landing Shot to 3 seconds.• Improve slightly the distance covered of these skills when Succession: Feathers of Lemoria is learned (like Call From Sky)This will fix partially the movement problems. There is a reason for the cd needing to be the same for some of the movement skills and its to match Prime: Extreme Charging Wind cooldown of 3 seconds. The mentioned movement skills cannot be used during cooldowns, have no damage or cc's and needs a lower cooldown to allow the class to have movement combo like many other classes. This will help repositioning in pve or simply move between mobs without getting random cc's (since its just movement, no cc or damage involved).• Remove falling animation from Flow: Air Explosion Shot, improve flowing into other skills (the 3 movement skills already mentioned), reduce the cooldown to 7 seconds (to match Prime: Evasive Explosion Shot cooldown), remove the staggering\n\nThis because usually when killing mobs in pve Call From Sky> Flow: Air Explosion Shot (foward) is used to move from pack to pack but the combo is a suicide in any other terrain that is not completely flat because of the falling animation.

        "content": "Family Name: AkariSayioRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Maehwa SuccessionSuggestion: Buffs and bug fixesDetails: Hello [CM]Vedir. Thank you a lot for taking your time to look through all the post for how everyone sees classes. In my case, I would love to talk about my favorite class but also by far one of the worst class of the game which is Succession Maehwa. I love the class a lot but unfortunately it cannot keep up with the current meta of fully SA protected damage. Maehwa succession has too many unprotected combos and uses way too much stamina compared to most of other classes. For me to be able to keep up with the other classes, I am in the obligation to use my Tiger blade skill so I can follow up which has a CD of 2min30 . While for damage, the only big damage skills that we have are redmoon level 3(SA) /Prime: Blooming and Divider.\nFor the changes that would make the class better that I was thinking of are:\n1 : Damage issues,\n- If we could have level 3 Redmoon do as much damage as Petal Bloom would do. Unfortunately we don't have as many skills as awakening maehwa for damage so to compensate it would be nice to have Redmoon do more damage and also Whirlwind do more damage as well since after redmoon all we can is blooming that is unprotected which does decent amount of damage if not decapitation but both blooming and decapitation are unprotected.\n2: Stamina issues.\n- Maehwa succession runs out of stamina incredibly fast. What would really help her it would be to make the skill PRIME:CARVER not use stamina ( everytime someone is stunned or stiff, if I have no stamina , I cannot follow up to knock them down unless I have level 3 redmoon).\n- The skill PRIME: WHIRLWIND should be the same as it used to be. Unfortunately right now everytime we use it , it consumes 20-30% of our stamina where we used to have it make us regain our stamina. PRIME: WHIRLWIND is hard to use because as soon as we are out of stamina we just stop moving.\n- For last skill in stamina issues . PRIME:DIVIDER uses a lot of stamina really quickly and as soon as we run out , character stops moving or if not has the weapon not out anymore so I need to take it out again.\n3: Protection issues\n- The full damage combo of succesion Maehwa consist of 20% protection and 80% unprotected.\n- Getting forward guard on PRIME:Blooming, Super armor on decapitation when out of CD everytime (not only when level 3 red blade) and making PRIME:FROSTFEINT fully SUPER ARMOR.\n- Right now PRIME:FROSTFEINT has super armor dash into unprotection hit. Unfortunately we get knocked way too often as soon as we use the skill, as if it's actually not protected at all. If we could make it super armor dash into super armor hit it would make is way more better for the class."

Allow Haladie Assault and Hourglass of Death with dual glaives without the need to \"tab cancel.\" (Putting away your weapons to use the pre-awakened kit)\n2. Hourglass of Defiance should have a visual effect around the stationary tornado that represents the recall distance (For example, a floating sand ring at the max distance)\n3. Put rupture on a different key combination than RMB so it doesn't overlap with Tail Cutter and doesn't immediately flow from Ridge Reaver during hit acceleration.\n4. Get rid of the wind-up animations off of Paradise Surge, collapse, and Ridge Reaver. (Avoids issues with hit acceleration)\n5. Add a note on aal's dominion's tooltip that says \"Can be used with your dual glaives in certain situations with shift+spacebar\" \n\n*These changes were considered with the idea of awakening hashashin's high mobility, incredible utility, low amounts of safe burst damage, lack of an easily-accessible dedicated I-frame, and certain animation locks.\n\nNerfs:\n1. Nerf the slow from Ensnaring Sand and Quick sand down to 10% and 5-second duration like warrior's Grave Digging. (This should be done with all slows in the entire game. I even advocate for no slows nor attack speed buffs whatsoever. If a class is too fast to be caught, the class should be slowed down or made more vulnerable)\n 2. Hourglass of Recall is on too short of a Cooldown (11 seconds is more appropriate so it can only be used twice per tornado placement)\n3. Lower the range of Serpent's Coil.\n4. make mirage assault, and mirage cost 100 stamina instead of being free while allowing stamina to continue regenerating.\n5. remove the stiff from haladie throw. (Ranged CC's are cringe)\n\nBuffs:\n1. Allow Ultimate: Sand Warp (pre-awakened) to be used out of Descent, Quicksand, Aal's Breath, Haladie Assault, Piercing tornado, Tail Cutter, and ridge reaver. (This would be a very cool way of fixing some of ambassador's animation locks while also giving them another tool to utilize) \n2. Allow all the normal flows out of 25% black spirit rage dune slash as normal dune slash\n3. Make crown kick SA and give voracity the ability to be used on a quick-slot like awakened lahn's vice and put it on a cooldown similar to serpent's coil.\n4. Remove the down smash off of dune strike, voracity, and crown kick.\n5. Allow Hourglass of Recall from right-hand glaive grapple\n6. Make Sand Tornado Super Armor on startup and make the invulnerable portion of the animation go as far as guardian's infernal nemesis and cost 600 stamina. Leave the ending animation unprotected.\n7. Add some sort of way to heal out of combat such as awakening lahn's bloody stride, archer's breath of the spirit, musa's musa spirit, warrior's pulverize, one of berzerker's 3 different healing abilities, etc. (750 HP heal on hourglass of defiance that way you are forced to choose between an in-combat heal and placing the tornado as an escape tool. It is also on a 25-second cooldown so it isn't able to be spammed)\n\nRework:\n1. Remove Sin Splitter's bound and its damage while replacing it with an i-frame. Increase the cooldown to 14 from 6 seconds. (Multi-hit CC's are cringe)\n2. Remove Piercing tornado's float. (Protected multi-hit CC's are very cringe)\n3. Remove the float from arid assault and replace it with forward guard for the kneeling animation and Super Armor on landing as well as make it cost 250 stamina and remove the AP requirement to cast the skill. (Arid assault is way too oppressive against some classes and doesn't do anything against others. Turn it into a movement skill without CC for a more balanced experience while also not removing a mobility option.)\n4. Make Way of Aal apply invulnerable instead of Super Armor and increase stamina consumption from 400 to 600 \n\nBug Fixes:\n1. Getting up with weapons put away is very consistent.\n2. Sometimes when you get CC'd in flow: sand warp due to desync, your stamina does not recover and even drains down to 0.\n3. Tab-canceling does not allow you to use pre-awakened abilities until you sheath your weapons.\n4. Z-axis and walls eating my damage is disgusting on this class.\n5. The grab is a mess; sometimes they end up in front of me, sometimes behind me, sometimes off a cliff. Whatever you did to make lahn grab work consistently, do it to hashashin's grab.\n6. Flow: sand warp is very prone to hit acceleration. (When you're getting hit multiple times and so your animation speeds up and you end up not going anywhere with your dash). I do not know if you can fix this. I would be very impressed if you could.\n\nSomething to think about: succession hashashin and awakened hashashin do their jobs very differently yet share class modifiers. It might be time to consider separating succession classes from awakened class modifiers. Then again, the hole that was dug is pretty deep. I'm not sure if you would be able to handle that task.\n\nAlso, remove resists in PvP\n\nAlso also, for the love of all that is holy move the servers to Chicago or Houston"

        "content": "Family Name: Naverite\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Succession Nova\nSuggestion:\n1. Fixing Stamina Issues\n2. Removing Axian's health drain and reworking Axian’s enrage\n3. Non-Command Skills PVE buff\n4. Quoratum’s Vigor Rework\n5. Adding Forward Guard to Winter Testudo\n \nDetails:\n\nMy suggestion to fix the stamina issues is to reduce the stamina cost of Quoratum’s opening from 300 stamina (current cost on live) to 200 stamina.\n\nReasoning: Succession Nova has massive movement problems. Currently it is one of the slowest classes and cannot disengage any fight. The nova is forced to be committed to every fight. On live server Succession nova is generally relegated to 4 dashes entirely until she is out of stamina.  Not only does that hurt her ability to keep up with Ball groups in endgame PVP, but it also severely limits her movement in PVE. By reducing the stamina cost the nova could then have an additional dash to move more often in PVE before running out of stamina and have a easier time keeping up with ball groups in PVP.\n\nMy Suggestion to remove axian’s health drain mechanic and rework his enrage mechanic is to have his hit receive life-steal or heal on hit effect. He most certainly should have the CC combo that he does during enraged removed for this or else it would be over tunned. \n\nReasoning: Axian’s health drain is an abysmal mechanic design.  In PVP fights the Nova is actively helping her opponent kill her by being aggressive, which promotes a more passive playstyle that a majority of other classes strongly dislike. Going further, Axian’s enrage is designed to help protect the Nova as she gets low, but in its current iteration it is actively hurting the Nova. His attack pattern in enrage (CC >disappear > CC > disappear > long damage > disappear > repeat) actively hurts the Nova in PVP after the initial cc if it even lands due to him CC caping the opponent and weaking the nova’s own command skill damage because he is uncontrollable. A suggestion that has been passed around a lot among other Nova’s is to rework his enrage to provide a life steal on hit mechanic similar to Drak’s ions but on a fairly long CD.  This would allow Axian’s enrage to serve a better purpose in protecting the Nova as he is actively trying to heal her and help her in her frontliner role. I also think that removing the CC mechanic that he has during enrage will heavily reduce other class’s frustrations when playing against the nova and would make my proposed version more balanced by allowing the nova to be a more aggressive instead of promoting a more “Turtle” playstyle that is widely seen in PVP.\n\nNon-Command Skills need more damage and self-buffs added to them for PVE. Currently Succession Nova has 0 accuracy self-buffs or evasion debuffs in her current kit. Add in the fact that a majority of her non-Command skills do abysmal damage across the board and you get the current state of Succession nova PVE.\n\nReasoning: Currently Succession Nova is heavily accuracy starved in PVE and even with accuracy accessories she struggles heavily. My proposed suggestion would be to add in these accuracy self-buffs and debuffs to the non-Command skills such has Prime: Bitter Reign, and Prime: Vengeful Star. Currently these skills have very low damage and server no real purpose in Succession Nova’s PVE rotation. Adding in more PVE damage and these Buffs and Debuffs to those skills would allow them to serve a purpose in her PVE rotation. They also need damage buffs For PVE ONLY. It is worth noting that Succession Nova’s PVP damage is fine currently and doesn’t need to be tuned.  \n\nQuoratum’s Vigor passive is in desperate need for a rework. Currently on live its gives us 45 Out of combat HP recovery. This should be changed to something that works in combat or provides a flat benefit such as flat hp.\n\nReasoning: Currently this passive is worthless for a combat class. With Succession Nova’s theme of being a frontline class it should be changed to provide her with more Hp or an extra small heal every few seconds in combat.  A balanced version would be like around 200 hp or a small heal of 30-40 hp every 5 seconds while in combat to beef her up in a frontline role. The changing to a flat passive amount is probably the easier option and likely to cause less problems.\n\nWinter Testudo should have a forward guard protection added.\n\nReasoning: Currently Winter Testudo is an unprotected wall that is supposed to stop enemy pushes and protect your allies. In its current form the animation is too long for its unprotected state and usually means that any fast quick CC such as a stiffen or bound will completely cancel the skill which has a 2-minute CD. The proposition of adding a Forward guard will continue with the theme of it being a frontal wall to stop pushes and allow the nova some breathing room to get it off if used with proper positioning. As a frontal guard it would still have its draw backs, and would give opponents an opportunity to counter in the windup animation with their own good positioning or fast grabs.\n \n \nLastly I would highly encourage any non-Succession Nova player to watch the attached Streamable to better understand how the pawns actually CC.  https://streamable.com/6wubq9"

        "content": "Family Name: Wootaru\nRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): ShaiSuggestion:  Make Shai a proper class, there has been no clear path for this class from PA.Details: We are a Precious class isn't cutting it anymore.  We cannot do much in the game with nerfs after nerfs.  Our Damage is low to efficiently PvP to defend ourselves, we have no mobility or get away mechanic. If we try to disengage any fights we will get CC'd because the only ability we have for a \"Disengage\" (Yippie!) Has a long start up animation, no protection what so ever, and a long ending animation. We constantly get bullied out of solo spots, since the only real group party location a Shai would be at is Oluns. What about the people who just wanna solo stuff to grind? Every other class can do so, why can't the Shai solo places comfortably? -Yippie! - Needs to be changed significantly. If you do not want us to fight in a 1 v 1, allow us to escape and disengage then. This is a decent addition that I asked them to add back in the AoA round table talk, but poorly implemented. The reason why they said that the ability should not be protected is that there should not be any class with a high mobility skill with any strong protection. Well, Look at the other classes, Like DK, Zerker, Ninja, Kuno, Strikers, Musa, Mystics, Maewha, literally almost every other class. Pretty much an extremely fast class with a lot of protections. Put a Shai in a mobility situation vs the other classes and throw down a bunch of CCs on top of them and look at who can escape compared to the Shais. On top of this badly implemented Skill, the stamina use on this skill is rediculous, 50% of our Stam is used most of the time using the skill and by the time we can actually catch up to the group to CC people we have no Stamina to use our skills.-Hop - iframe once every 3 seconds, Used as our Mobility, Extremely high stam usage. Although we have an iframe on this skill, most of the protection is wasted solely on Spam Hop + Lmb as a form of mobility. Maybe give us a Super Armor while off CD and while on CD it is an iframe, We would still take damage, but at least gives us some surviving chance to leave a fight with our lives. Although I wish I would like the ability to have an iframe every hop since the stam cost is rediculous and literally can let us disengage more efficiently I doubt that this would be implemented. I would be surprised if you even look at this skill. -No S Block, our Foward Guard last 0.5 Seconds and on a 6 second Cooldown. 1 very special iframe for 3 seconds (Play dead) on a 5 minute Cooldown. 5 MINUTES we don't do damage, we don't get bonus DP / Evasion for it we get a 50 HP heal per second. I have 8000 HP, and any non horrible PvPer when they don't see a kill feed will camp our body.-Lifeskill passives are obsolete, no one does life skilling expecting to level up from it. As a matter of fact all life skillers tend to want to stay under lvl 50 so they don't have to deal with a bunch of people trying to kill them or greif them. So why do people care to get more EXP while doing mundane activity? If I wanted to I can leech at a spot for about 1-2 hours and get to level 61. Why in the world would I go gather for hours on end for maybe 1% Exp at 56? Not much a difference from people getting 0.4% exp at 56, no one cares about the exp difference when gathering or doing alchemy. You can also get to professional 1 in about 15 minutes so making a Shai is what, saving 15 minutes out of your day, then you can go on being the worst lifeskiller in the game?\n\n-With the amount of protections now days, Forest echoes does not live up to any type of current PvP standards anymore. Too many protections from the enemy player leaves our class extremely vunerable. We only have Super armor so any ranged classes get to freely damage us from the outside without any risk. We would either need an Evasion / DP buff while using the skill, or let us add some addons to the Bongo ability so we can adjust to current meta classes. Let us adjust things to our play style, if a person wants to be a CC bot tank, let them add DP to the ability, if someone wants to play aggressive and front line, let them go in and put a - AP on enemies that get caught in it. We need Addons for our offensive talents otherwise you will see a huge lack of Shais using any talent abilities.\n\n-AoA happened 1 year ago without any knowledge of the current content (Calpheon Elvia, Underground Gyfins) the 20% Radius and damage increase on our 1 2 3 skill was needed for Shais to keep up with the other classes farming Serendia Elvia locations (This was a suggestion from me). Before the buff we were farming about 40% slower than the other classes in the game, afterwards we were closing the gap to be up to par with the current grinding average at those locations. With newer content that was never released at the time the Shais were able to maintain a good average and was able to see a farming location where we can farm on a above Par average, due to our lack of mobility the spots which reduces the amount of moving around the Shai is a heaven sent location for us to comfortably farm. With the Nerfs reducing my suggestion is a huge slap in the face, not only did I have to win one of your tournements to even talk to PA and help the class as a whole and have more class diversity in your game, but PA is literally killing the class. I even put into consideration not to over step any boundaries and making the class an over powered meta class, I gave PA a suggestion with a very reasonable and detailed break down on why I believe that our Damage increase was a necessity. It doesn't make us a PvP god, it doesn't make us a PvE God, it just make us a Viable class.-Nerfing our damage for end game content is not the way to go, not only do you ruin the end game grind, you also ruined the Serendia Elvia grind for any new players wanting to play the Shai class. You cannot tell us to go to Centaurs because with our horrible mobility we do not make anywhere near the faster classes. We cannot tag another class because of the Artina Sol, other classes cannot tag to the Shai without making their own Personal PEN artina Sol. PA is making it extremely difficult for this class over all. Our Artina sol does not give us the benefits of a Dandilion or even a Blackstar awakening weapon. We do not get accuracy, we do not get monster damage, and we do not get any more AP from the ratios. -I ask that PA please consider making a Shai a real class with a Succession (DPS focus) and Awakening (Support, Tank Focus) I have an SP Capped Shai for ages and sitting on 1900+ unused SP. I can go into more details since this requires pages of needed changes and I only can scratch the surface on this.\n\n\n\nBest,\nWootaru"

        "content": "THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF MY PREVIOUS POST, PLEASE REFERENCE TO THAT POST ON PAGE 5Succession Mystic: While It's hard for me to speak on Succession Mystic's specific best nerfs in my eyes, due to the lack of her player population in NA, I will isntead be touching on guantlet general issues, and potentially some minor issues the class has. I think the main reason that Succession Mystic is currently so OP, is due to her overall wide utility, and access to outplay in nearly every scenario, both from tankiness, having a strong grab, ability to combo damage efficiently, and an ease of access to slows that completely kill opponents gameplay. I will be trying to address some of these problem to tune it down, but not attempting to kill any of these aspects.\n \n- Binding Knee Strike (Succession mystics grab), Remove the KD from it and change it to a Bound or a Float.\n        > KD Grabs are the most ridicuously punishing and OP thing in the game, and frankly, i'm not sure why they exist, especially on a class such as Mystic, which has a large ease of access to KD's available. This being a part of her kit, allows her to pump out more damage than realistically necessary, and is a large part of why she can 1 combo players in many aspects of the game, TOO easily. Removing this will give more room for opponents, and address her damage strengths.\n \n- Remove the 30% AS from Prime: Amplify Martial Spirit\n        > From an overall perspective, I think no one will deny in saying this is the most OVERLOADED all-rounder E buff in the game. Not only providing a massive DP Steroid, but also simultaneously providing a massive AP Steroid. A large portion of why a mystic is so scary, is that this E buff makes her damage come out at break neck speeds, added on top of the damage. The best solution is to keep the AP Steroid, and completely remove the AS steroid, which puts this too much over the top. A class like mystic and striker, were not built with their skills to pump them out and crazy high speeds, they were built to put them out at consistent speeds with higher damage values. This AS does not reflect that design philosophy. \n \n- Give Prime: Wave Orb the Grave Digging treatment, and reduce the slow from 30% for 10s on all slows to 10% for 5s on all slows. \n      > if we were willing to nerf Grave Digging for being too strong of a skill for an ease of access to slows, and killing opponents gameplay, this skill is just as toxic. Unlike grave digging which wasn't a heavy damage pump on its own, Wave Orb is part of Mystics nuke combo, on top of stackign a mass slow with it. Removing this alone alleviates a massive strain while fighting mystic, and gives more room for opponents to fight her, that under normal circumstances SHOULD have the upper hand, but often will instantly fall behind when eating the slow. \n \n- Change Thunder Poud from a 3s to a 5s Cooldown.\n    > I mean, not sure what really needs to be said. Having a Stiffen -> KD multi hit ability, that regenerates its cooldown by the time it's exited, with damage attached is frankly ridiculous. This on any other kit would typically be 7s or so, I really have no clue why the cooldown on this is so short. It's overloaded with utility and having such a short cooldown opens up too many aspects of gameplay, on top of being a crutch that removes positional awareness from the kit. \n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------\n \nAwakening Striker: Similar to the issue with Mystic, not really gonna try to re-iterate. Stiker is a bit easier on the solution aspect however.\n \n- Remove the KD from Striker's Pre-awakening Grab Absolute: Massive Suppression and change it to a bound\n       \n          > Same concept as Mystic on her pre-awakening grab, so I'm just going to repost it. KD Grabs are the most ridicuously punishing and OP thing in the game, and frankly, i'm not sure why they exist, especially on a class such as Striker, which has a large ease of access to KD's available. This being a part of his kit, allows him to pump out more damage than realistically necessary, and is a large part of why he can 1 combo players in many aspects of the game, TOO easily. Removing this will give more room for opponents, and address her damage strengths.\n \n- Remove the ability to linger hold the Grab on Striker, and have it only be able to do 1 hit before dropping the opponent.\n       \n        > Strikers ability to hold his grab during slows, reduces the effecteviness on pre-slows on striker, as in many scenarios he can linger his grab with slows applied until the slow duration has worn off, and then fully extend for a combo. It gives too much free room for striker in group play scenarios as well when stalling opponents in his grab, as seen by Berserker for example, which is a completely unneccessary mechanic. \n \n- Descent of Fury (striker's E buff), Adjust the SA walk portion to only be available for the first 10s of the ability\n \n       > The SA walk is extremely obnoxious as it allows little to no counter play for classes that are extremely stationary against striker.  It gives overall too much free room to the Striker player with no contention. On top of this, this ability is also EXTREMELY hard to grab due to d-sync, where when grabbing a walking striker, he can simply keep walking and it will say \"invalid target position\". If you can't fix the D-sync, remove this bullshit.\n- Remove the 10% Down attack modifier from Autumn Blaze        > A Super armor 10% down attack mod skill is a bit ridiculous considering the damage potential on striker kit already, and how extremely well this synergizes with the rest of his kit. I think this is a pretty necessary and not at all harmful change that will help mitigate the damage of the kit. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Succession Nova: This is a simple change to remove the most bugged and ridiculously OP AI abusabe skill in the game. Frankly this skill has no thought intention behind, and often times it will proc so many times, the opponent has no counterplay due to hit rate, on top of this ability penetrating through stealth, V, and even follows V while the user is running away.- Remove the float from Prime: Icy Prison            > Simple change that will remove a lot of the extremely toxic aspects from nova's gameplay, that many players hate. The class doesn't need much more removed, it just needs this issue addressed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Succession Hash: After the most recent buffs, Succesion Hash has reached an extremely solid spot in the meta, both with his damage and his ability to follow up opponents with strong CC potential. However, there is 1 aspect of the class that SHOULD be addressed 100%, as considering his new tools it does not fit well within his kit. - Nerf the slow on Absolute and Prime: Quicksand (Flow: Flow: Sand Prison) to 10% over 5s             > Quicksand is one of the largest AoE slows in the game, with a reach that extends even farther then gravedigging in many scenarios, largely due to the ability to be mouse-moved. Even when under no mouse-move, the lockdown area potential of this skill is too strong, for how unpunishing it is for the hash user, as they do have access to immediete i-frame escape from this skill, with no issue of counter punishing grabs. Considering hash's current position as a damage pumper with no large active tankiness after the changes, a large effective slow no longer fits his kit in my eyes on succession as he is a damage dealer, not a zone controller.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Succession Berserker: Super simple adjustments needed. Succ berserker is in a good spot, however his tankiness can be too unpunishing in some scenarios, due to how Weakling hunt work in his kit. The second problem is the strength of his grab, and the fact that users are UNABLE to V out of his grab. - Add the ability so that when users Emergncy Escape in Berserkers grab, his grab is canceled and you are able to move away.      > With berserkers current grab, if you Emergency Escape too early, you still have to sit in Emergency Escape for the entire animation of his grab, and as a result are exited closer nearby, resulting in a death due to the wake up time of V. By making it so that on Emergency Escape, the grab is cancelled and you can move away as normal in any other scenario, this issue does not occur and his grab is not as strong. - Adjust the +15 DP Buff on Weaklint hunt, to be changed from on use, to on hit         > It's currently too easy to proc the +15 DP buff from weaklint hunt which makes him overall too tanky, due to it being on use, meaning a 24/7 uptime rotation with no target, rather then on hit.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Awakening Valkyrie: A large reason for why Awakening Valk is so strong at the high end currently, similar to every other class mentioned, is due to her plethra of utility and skills, however she is much more able to enable her TEAM, not only herself. I think adjusting some of these aspects down will help to solve this problem.- Remove the 3s SA that is applied to ALLIES on Breath of Elion      > The 3s SA makes sense on applying to herself, but overall makes no sense on applying to allies for valk. This ability can be used offensively and defensively for team scenarios currently, and while I have no issues with this flexibility, the ability to enable her allies to completely STAND UP when receiving a combo on them, due to the SA is too strong, as the ability already provides a % HP heal. Removing the 3s SA will fix this problem, letting it only be used as a heal, and still keeping her allies on the floor. - Remove the ability to heal Allies for 20% when using Purificatione (technically 60% due to hitting 3 times), have it only apply to self     > Once again, while already having access to 2 heals (1 through rabam) having another team heal added is a bit unneccessary. While it's fine to self heal as she is meant to be a tankier class in this aspect (on hit heal 80 per hit as designated by the tooltip) It doesn't make sense for it to also heal allies for a % heal at the same time. This is just a bit too much, and gives her too much teamplay strength. - Remove the stun on the 100% BSR Sanctitas de Enslar.       > While the damage and speed are fine, the large issue with the 100% BSR currently is the ability to enter large groups with PA up, and then instantly stun all opponents around you followed up by the large KD nuke. Removing the stun gives more opportunity for opponents to escape, and forces valk to not use this so easily, and be smarter about their choices in the 100. Essentially giving the ability more finess and requiring more skill to output a successfull 100% BSR. With the current version, it's too easy to land up follow up CC's and damage with how fast the ability is after reboots, having made it MUCH faster and with a much higher tick rate on the stun. Overall I think this is the best route to go through. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Succesion Witch/Wizard: I think succession witch/wizard is honestly in a strong spot in the game currently, and doesn't need much tuning down. I think really the only aspect that needs a minor tuning is the consistency of slows that are pumped out from Succesion witch/wiz. Unfortunately, currently it is too easy to kite out many classes with not high burst mobility, due to the effectiveness of slows on opponents. Now while the easiest solution would be to remove the ability of adding slow add-ons, this obviously would apply to too many classes and doesn't work. Instead, I have a different proposal: - Remove the slow from Prime: Lightning Storm: High Voltage, and keep the slow on all other lightning skills.            > This is a skill that is simply too frequently used and spammed out from witch wizard, while also having no real downsides to it. A high damage ranged nuke, with a slow attached, and the ability to add even more slow add-ons, doesn't realistically work. It's practically 100% uptime, coupled with every other slow they have access too. Either removing this slow, massively reducing its duration would be the best approach to address the effectivesness of wizard/witch in kiting, and group play. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I appreciate the time you took to read through all of my suggestions! Please realize that I am very serious among all of these changes, and this is based off of my experience throughout my years as a player. While there are classes that require buffs, adding these changes will bring classes realistically all more in line, and give more space to other classes that in many scenarios would otherwise be weak. If you want a more personal talk regarding this, you're always free to reach out to me through my discord, which you can find I'm sure! Thanks!"

If the target is marked by another skill the animation is faster with the speed of Hash grab cancel to the left. Ok guys lets get down to some serious business.  I am a serious player, who actually goes out of towns and not like the billions of Shai players who want new underwear. Currently what DK and Musa have is simply . . . DMG, but guess what ?  ...  Everyone has dmg since its a 1shot meta, most ppl under Choice's 750 gear score 1combo each other so then what comes next as factors ? Mobility , Defense and GRAB.DK has gaps in protection some intentional and others just a *feature* bug *cough*. Fix the dam gaps.Lets see at mobility. Valk and Warrior have more pressure chasing but on top of them having an SA BLOCK they have DMG and big SLOW help him chase. How can we deal with SA Block ? Wait for them to run->grab and if failed SA Block again and ignore you. Valk Train is so mobile forward wise if you flag you ain't catching this as DK. But on top of having the best defense in the game they get the best offense in the game and the best counter to other SA Blocks: GRAB. What does DK Lack ? Both the best defensive tool and the best offensive tool that can deal with the said defensive tool. How does DK deal with grab since you can't get close because almost all of your skills are slow af and you'll get grabbed - spam Seed of Catastrophe-> Shattering Darkness->repeat. Mystik and Striker have so much defense to use just from ratios they dont even need an SA Block, they can just ignore us or even better if its Succ Mystic spamm the kicks, spam the punches, repeat those two skills until you hit DK's gap. All top classes are fully protected, zerkers and ninjas go through my NW Ball, zerker/sorcs/valk/warrior/ninja always making ppl look like donkeys for trying to fight them yet they can't be ignored cuz everyone has insane dmg but not equally insane defense or mobility. Sure not every class has to be the same but when 14-15 classes have all the tools and 4-5 have simply 1 tool(dmg) it isn't close to a fair fight."

        "content": "Family Name: Holunseven\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Succ Nova\nSuggestion: PVP Balance\n\nDetails: I want to preface this by saying Succ Nova is no doubt a very strong class. I play this as my main and I will be the first one to say it is very strong. However, the perceived strength of the class is in my opinion amplified by other players’ lack of understanding and reluctance to learn the class. I will point out the main things below.\n\n\nIcy Prison: The problem with this skill is 2 fold: First (the smaller problem) is players’ lack of understanding of the skill—there are different conditionals to this skill, in other words, the skill does different things under different parameters (e.g. having a target vs no target, etc). Second (the bigger problem) is coincidentally 1 of the conditionals of the skill: when casted freely WITHOUT a target. There is nothing wrong with the concept of free casting without a target, however there is an issue when the game decides the targeting under this condition. The combination of the skill ignoring stealth, the skill’s inherent delay, plus server desync means you get drastically crazy outcomes. Basically, when you cast this skill without a target (NO red crosshair) the game targets the closest person that is within the skill’s targetable range AT THE TIME of the cast (the moment the button was pressed). Now, mix in with the skill delay (Axian does not come out the right away, there is literally a second delay from pressing of the skill to animation of dragon flying) where people can end up dashing/moving a mile away within that second then you will end up with some really crazy outcomes. This is because once the game registers a target, it locks on the target even if they move out of range. My opinion on how the skill should work is to leave the targeted (when you cast with red crosshair) portion the same, but change the no-target part. The game should never choose a target for you. Axian should just go where the crosshair is pointing when casted without a target. If the player did not target anyone, then cast the skill where the crosshair is like any other skills in the game.\n\n\nEnraged Axian: The problem with this skill is the so called random/no-skill cc that everyone talks about. I can objectively say this statement is only half true. It is arguably no skill because it triggers automatically sub 40% HP. However, it is far from random. The skill literally triggers once the Nova is at 40% and has a timer interval on when it loops. BUT ironically, enraged axian isn’t even good. Want to know why? Because we lose our ability to command Axian when enraged. That means all of our skill that normally has Axian in the animation does substantially less damage (because Axian isn't there anymore), and all utility skills like Icy Prison and Command Opening also loses the Axian part (e.g. no float on icy prison). This is terrible for our kit. The entire enrage mechanic should just be reworked. Remove everything about the current enrage and replace it with something like % damage increase on Axian skills when enraged. That way the enraged state actually serves a purpose for the Nova and other players will stop complaining about the CC because they refuse to count the time intervals.\n\n\nPet Stiffs: This issue is 3 fold: 1/3 player misconception of the skill, 1/3 bug, and 1/3 auto targeting like Icy Prison. Pets no longer ‘auto stiff’. This was patched/changed a while ago when they removed Command Opening to auto proc on Q block. Pets now ONLY stiff when the Nova actively presses Command: Opening. However that said, there is a bug where enemy players will sometime still get stiffed without command opening. The nova discord have submitted multiple support tickets to get this patched/looked at. So ball is in PA’s court. The last part is the auto targeting that happens when casted without red crosshair. The pets end up going to the closest target again. Just remove that, and have them go to where the crosshair is and the problem is solved.\n\n\nStamina: This is a huge issue for Novas. In the current meta where there’s so much movement, we easily get left behind in the fight. Worse yet, we get run down to oblivion. There needs to be a better balance between some classes with almost infinite movement and Novas who can’t move after a few dashes.\n\n\nGrab: For the love of god, please fix our grab. Our grab is the only grab not protected on success in the game. When grabs were reworked, there was an official post on the website saying all grabs on success will have super armor (source: https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=2127&countryType=en-US ). Yet, Nova is the only class without it."

        "content": "Family Name: BrovekuRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Berserker SuccessionSuggestion: Frontal on beast form minor class buff while on CD (C)Details:\n\nthis doesnt apply to awaken zerk.\n\nI understand that alot of people hate the idea of succ zerker getting a buff and I see plenty of suggestions for succ zerker to have even more removed from the kit but one thing that has always bothered me was the fact the big beast boi zerker doesnt have a q block. My suggestion would be to give him a frontal on his C ability while its on CD,(hold c for frontal guard) when off CD the ability can still be just a second of SA or even have the frontal during the SA portion as well. My justification for this is succ zerker (as protected as it is) must be moving and consuming resources in order to be this way, if these things are changed or tweaked id like to see zerker have the ability to q block to fill the moments of being unprotected. Zerker is also a class who has a majority of the protected abilities animation lock me in place with some skills being unable to cancel or cancel quickly, the ability to survey the battlefield in a q block instead of having to spam SA abilities and movement just to be safe to me feels like a nice QoL change that doesnt drastically buff the class. This feels like a balanced addition when you consider the ability will be nothing more than a holding frontal (cant move) and maybe a second of SA when used on CD. ESPECIALLY when compared to the likes of valk or warrior with a perma SA/frontal q block (warrior can literally walk around) This also feels thematically proper as 2 GIANT axes should be plenty to form a blockade in front of me."

There is a gap between protections and desync exposes this gap and we are cc'd while simply chasing around. It is generally worse when using chase cancel in preawakening. Stamina cost reduction would help with engagement, combat, and disengagement. \n\n- Chase remove collision from forward Chase.\n* Reason: Collision with chase gets us stuck in team fights with our allies or groups of enemies. Back chase has no collision but exposes our backs to taking extra damage. \n\n\n- Sleet Steps change from Super Armor to Iframe off cooldown, reduce cooldown to 3 seconds.\n * Reason: To replace the chase iframe but to provide a better defensive tool that we can control and use for various situations. \nExamples: Red Moon > sleet iframe or Petal Bloom > Sleet iframe etc.. to bait and counter grabs as well as simply using sleet to dodge heavily damage abilities. Give the player the choice to choose when to iframe. \n\n- Blooming Step  change from Frontal Guard to Super Armor, increase distance traveled and increase speed of animation. \n * Reason: The intention is to make this skill a useful disengage tool. We lack a skill like Fiery Angel, and this skills offensive potential is nill. This skill would be better served as a utility tool. Our main thing is our ability to chase around the battlefield but we end up with no stamina after an engagement, thus leaving us in bad situations or forced to play by a 10 second rule. 10 seconds in and then out. Having a proper disengage tool could extend our ability to stay in the fight. \n\n- Ultimate Maehwa's Will change the heal from 450 HP to 900 HP on use. \n * Reason: This one is fairly straight forward. We take a ton of damage in this meta and have a better heal would help us get back into the fight. 450 HP was useful back when we had 2200 HP\n\n- Succession as a Kit delete it.\n* Reason: Just look at it.. its sad. No one likes sad things... jk will update later."

        "content": "Family Name: ThunderPoundRegion: NAClass: Mystic (Succession)Suggestion: Succession Mystic balance ideasDetails: Succession Mystic current state is actually overtuned for where the kit shines - small scale, and it requires some adjustments.  As a day 1 Succ Mystic main i watched the class continuously getting buffed in the wrong way (adding more dmg) when in reality that was the wrong approach into her kit, making it too simple to the point its easy to learn and abuse but hard to master. The issue lies on the fact that the basics is already strong enough. Also we could have more depht if half of our kit wasnt actually locked and the other half wasnt 50% situational leaving us with a Thunderpound / Soulbasher spam for core gameplay. Here are my suggestions:\n\n Grab - Currently our grab have a 15s CD which is fine, given that the reboot gave us more mobility and more stamina management options but introduced a huge gap because our most common engage revolves around Flash Step into Grab, so Flash Step ending is unprotected and Grab start is also unprotected, making the skill more risky than it should (can check the gap here: https://streamable.com/uvf5vr) \n\nFix: Change the grab CC type from Knockdown to Bound but fix the gap ON SUCESSFULL GRABS ONLY - old state was slightly fast SA on every attempt, which is not our current pattern for grabs balancing, but we shouldnt be punished by being able to play well and land the grab just because the game wants to. We need this addressed as it greatly impacts our Mass PvP / turning fights potential given that gauntlets overall eat too much dmg anyway. \n\n\n\n Prime: Sea Burial - Remove Seal Burial Shard spender capabilities.\nReason: This skill damage is bad with or without shards, and is mostly used as movement and stamina management. Most of the time you will end up wasting your 3 Shards with it in situations where you dont want to. PLEASE DONT GIVE US THE DAMAGE BUFF TREATMENT!!!\nFix Sea Burial interaction with falling animation, giving it more head room. We cant even use Twisted Collision > Sea Burial in any slightly irregular terrain because it will just get you killed. (Example: https://www.twitch.tv/vnbz_/clip/OutstandingPlumpMouseShazBotstix-ZQdRLVoZ4nNY3CXU?filter=clips&range=30d&sort=time)\nReason: Pretty please? \n\n\nStaggering - I dont know if theres much you can do about the Staggering effect that happens when you are getting hit by multiple skills and that accelerates the skills animations / protections as it seems to be a engine problem, but given that Mystic is a short ranged class, most of the time we are on those situations, making our protections end too soon or giving weird interactions. Most notably skills that suffers from that are Sea Burial, Rage Hammer and Flash Step. \n\n\n\nStamina Cost on dmg skills - I think Mystic is one of the few classes that have stamina costs as requirement for dmg skills, so remove stamina cost for  Somersault,  Adamantine and  Triple Flying Kick\n\n\n\nRemove / Add skill interactions:\n\nRemove:\n  Prime: Tornado Kick into Prime: Hidden Claw prioritizes Hidden Claw connection into last hits KD. Please remove that interaction as we dont wanna use Hidden Claw as dmg outside of 1v1 combos and we definitely dont wanna use that sequence either for our 1v1 combos because we got better options.\n\nAdd:\n  Prime: Flash Step into Prime: Rage Hammer gapless. Succ mystic is a connection spec, which means we must connect one skill into another to cancel the previous skill gap or flow the animation better. On the case of rage hammer, we are forced into weird interactions like Flash Step > Sea Burial > Rage Hammer or Flash Step > Mass Destruction 1 hit > Rage Hammer. By giving us the ability to cancel Flash Step Gap with Rage Hammer we would be able to have more skilled options and plays given that we are constantly cancelling Flash Step gap somehow.\n\n Absolute: Rib Crusher into  Prime: Tornado Kick. This is more of an attempt based on suggestion i gave up further in this post. By adding said linkage we would be able to do sequences like   on a Knocked down target for a safe protected damage filler without applying CCs unintendly (considering all changes i suggested to our kit)\n\n\n\n\n Thrashing Wolf - Reduce the cooldown from 15s to 12s. Allow us to cancel the animation lock portion with Silent Step, Mass Destruction, Crouching Wolf, Flash Step (those four are already our current cancels) before the last hit portion.\nReason: Gives us more room for gameplay.\n Raging Wolf - Reduce the cooldown from 25s to 15s. Pretty weak rabam overall, Awakening can maintain 3 shards uptime most of the time, Succession can gen said shards easily too. Atleast reducing the cooldown this rabam might be used for 1v1s where you cant stack shards that easily? i dont know, feels lackluster overall, could be something else instead.\n\n Mass Destruction - Change all hits CC to first hit only. Change Stun to Stiffness on hit.\nReason: Balancing issues. We currently have way too much protected CCs\n\n Prime: Soulbasher - Current state is a noob trap. 3s Cooldown perma lingering SA? wow thats too good to be true, right? except the skill does 0 dmg, makes you stationary and is too slow/clunky to be used in any serious PvP. Also it takes away some of class learning curve because if you dont know what to do you just press F for a safeguard, which is a bad design overall.\nFix: Raise the cooldown to 6~8s but make the skill actually do something by improving the cast speed to simillar levels of thrashing wolf 3rd rabam, so it can be used as filler dmg which we lack. Also, if going that route, remove the Downsmash proc and maybe give 25% PvP crit.\n\n\n\nPrime: Thunderpound - Obnoxiously OP skill when our kit is mastered but also a noob trap. 3s Cooldown Frontal Guard with Downsmash proc, decent filler dmg, decent range, Stiffness into Knockdown and cancelling seamlessly into most of our kit? I would dare to say its our core and most important skill on the kit, and new players will spam it alot and get punished, which is ok, but current state is too much packed.\nFix: You can either raise the CD to 5s or change the Knockdown effect to Bound. This skill is kinda tricky to change because its also one of the window people have to punish Succ Mystic and basically her identity move, so proceed carefully on that one if you are not making real changes to the rest of the kit.\n\n\n\nCombo: Hurricane - Not a well known Prime skill because its hidden, but it has actually some good damage, but overall locked because input conflicts with Tornado Kick flowing from Thunderpound.\nFix: Change the input from F after Thunderpound to RMB after Thunderpound so we can actually unlock this skill and have some niche uses.\n\n\n\n Prime: Somersault - Add Super Armor to the skill. If we are following the changes into giving us an actual kit where we rotate more than 7 skills, then we need some actually usable fillers. Remove stamina cost as suggested before.\n\n\n\nPrime: Scissor Kick - Enable Tier 2 Addon choices for it, given that we are lacking on the useable addons department.\n\n\n\n Prime: Fist Fury - Make Frontal Guard backstep protection linger throught entirety of First Hit, similar to how Prime: Hidden Claw works.  Current this skill has close to no use, its unprotected, slow, it might be used as shard gen mid combo or backup float but honestly? its redundant, we have better options, simillar on how Hidden Claw is mostly used as iframe instead of combo piece, having another movement tool would be great.\n\n\n\n Flow: Sky Rammer - Remove Bound CC. Lower CD to 10s. Increase AoE radius by 50%. Currently we have no ways to cancel Landslide huge gap other than Sky Rammer. Also its our main climbing ability, and its already way worse than Strikers option, so having better up time would help a bit. As for the AoE radius, its focused on making Twisted Collision addons more appealing, like it is for striker.  \n\n\n\n Flow: Strikethrough - Remove Bound CC. Make this skill Invencible when vanishes into Superarmor with a gap that can be canceled through other skills like Crouching Wolf. Raise the CD to 10s. Currently this skill is useless because using it means getting CCed.\n\n\n\n Absolute: Rib Crusher - Swap Knockdown with Frontal Guard. This follow up is already fast enough if target is caught by Elbow Edge, but current Elbow usage is more like a disengage tool. By swapping CC to Frontal Guard, we would be able to use Disengaging Elbow into Rib Crusher from distance for a fast stamina recovering Frontal Guard. Also it would enable more combo variety, which we currently lack. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prime: Rage Hammer - Add 25% Crit for PvP.\n\n\nUnadressed flows (Hidden Claw Tree, Thunderpound Tree, Adamantine Tree) - Honestly those are all dated skills and would require a complete rework as they offer no connections, most of them are unprotected while having no damage whatsoever and too much CC.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Those suggestion changes are aimed into making Succession Mystic being able to rotate more skills instead of the forced spam that we get on current state. I addressed things like skill ceilling, making the class a bit harder to pilot but having actual options for damage and filler damage. The current gameplay is really fluid and fun but basically revolves around getting shards via Thunderpound and using a big damage spender like Rage Hammer or Wave Orb, giving us not alot of options other than stalling for those big impact skills. Please, keep in mind that if you just apply a nerf to this spec instead of a balance adjustment, she might fall too short like current Succession Kunoichi is and people will just migrate to her op brother, so yes. Feel free to dm me on discord at Vnbz#4352, i will be happy to discuss changes to the spec if needed. \n\nIf it serves any purpose, i played the class for a long time for good results in group PvP, so most of my suggestions are aimed at making the class have more depht.\nI would also like to see the carpeting thing addressed, like making both gauntlets actually killable on the floor but slightly more tankier when rotating protections correctly through some sort of sustain mechanic, but that would actually require a 2.0 rework at this point. Still, thats something you guys will have to address at some point. The class must be tanky for group content because you eat alot of damage, but that also breaks 1v1 / small scale experience for other players."

        "content": "Family Name: Aquarii\nRegion: EU\nClass: Tamer Succession (mainly) \nSuggestion: Real strength of tamer succession? \n\nDetails: Tamer Succession seemed to be based on the concept of having a better synergy with Heilang, and larger AOEs. But it doesn't work like that in PVP, as Heilang is unreliable, and AOE can be easily countered by our opponents. So, in pvp, Tamer are losing much unpredictability and movement options from awakening, for new strengths which are working in PvE only.\n\nSo I suggest :\n- more movement options for Tamer Succession, as someone suggested having  leaves/gust in succession would be nice. A reduced gap in Evasion could work too. \n- or better AOEs, more efficient (quicker activation, CCs, SA preferably as FG from skills quickly gets suicidal in mass fights) but not more damages. \n- or a mix of both.\n\nIn short, you should either emphasize the overall \"assassin\" side of tamer in both stances, with reliable movements ; or really differentiate both stances and make succession AOEs really reliable.\n\nAdditional suggestions :\n- Heilang have to be reliable, in both stances. I'd rather have Heilang doing nothing if I don't give a command, as long as he obeys quickly and reliably when I use a command or a skill\n- Still about Heilang, I understand that a ranged CC can be powerful (still, the current follow-up would deserve one or two additional ticks), but when Heilang is making a follow up on our character it should be more powerful. I suggest a different behavior based on the \"order\" given, with \"attack\" Heilang would tp on the target to do a slightly more efficient version of what we currently have, and with \"guard\" Heilang would tp on the tamer and do an improved version, with more ticks and a repeated staggering effect. Shorter distance = more power. \n- Obviously, I'd expect for succession to have better Heilang follow-ups than awakening. If we have to give up on awakening unpredictibility, we have to be able to rely on something else, Heilang and AOEs are the most obvious choices.\n- Prime : Allround Spinner... Well, that's underwhelming and FG has a limited efficiency on Tamer. I suggest to buff its damages and AOE and change into SA (to stay in line with succession based on deadly AOE around the tamer) ; or to change it into Prime : Cloud Stomping.\n- Give succession tamer a S block, please. As this stance is less mobile, it should at least be able to  block like that."

Next meme:Changes idea: Recover 20% HP when using the skill. Consume 50% of total mana on use. (Cooldown 75 Seconds.) My favourite Quake logo skill:Overall skill is helpful, but the potential and idea is too big and cool to miss it. Changes idea: Attack damage 735% x 10 (1029% x 10 on succession). While having 305+ AP and 80+ human it hit no more than 100 HP so less than potion use, but it feels like you dropping nukes while exploding.

        "content": "Family Name: MusaPlayerRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession):  Musa Succession\n Suggestion: Help Stamina Management\n Details: As it currently stands Succession Musa is very stamina starved class which is overly restrictive. Due to the nature of the skill Serene Mind almost every single skill cast in the kit has a sizable stamina cost, and often stamina lock on it as well. You have to spend stamina to position, pre buff, proc your Serene Mind buff, and then also to deal damage through casting skills like Prime: Gale and Prime: Blooming with Serene Mind. All of these stamina costs regularly force you to sit outside of the fight sitting in your q block, while often being pressured by other opponents which removes your ability to recover stamina at all, rendering you completely helpless. Removing the stamina locks from Prime: Fiery Angel and Prime: Back Step Slash would greatly relieve the class's current overburden, while still leaving it relatively stamina starved when compared to the rest of Black Desert's class roster, it's counterspec Awakening Musa especially. The disparity between these two classes are night and day. I don't think that Succession Musa should have the mobility of Awakening Musa, but currently it's stamina management feels overly punishing for using virtually any skill in the kit."

        "content": "Family Name: TobyRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Guardian (Awakening and Succession)\n\nSuggestion 1 (awakening and succession): Fix the slow bug that causes protections to be invalidDetails: When either succ or awakening guardian is slowed above a certain extent (45-50%) the infernal nemesis iframe and frost slide iframe become invalid and u can be damaged/cc'd during them. Within group fights where you are likely to have a lot of slows hit you, your slow effect can reach 50% pretty easily and therefore affect the iframes from the before-mentioned skills, therefore rendering them useless. \n\nSuggestion 2 (awakening): Bring awakening guardians damage up to par with other classes\nDetails: On the release of guardian awakening the class had good damage for the current climate of gear and classes in the game but as the meta and game evolved the awakening spec was able to keep up. In the current state of awakening guardian, it is IMPOSSIBLE to play it in large scale (where the class was basically designed for) and in groups fights in general due to the lack of damage the class can output. Cleansing flame deals nearly 0 damage and dragons maw takes too long to cast for the damage output it can perform. Secondly, God incinerator has ok damage output but due to the static nature of the skill and rather long cast time in retrospect to other classes, you are likely never able to actually use it for the full duration reducing its damage vastly. I would recommend either speeding god incinerator up or increasing the damage of the skill overall. For a class to be designed as an SA trading class and not be able to SA trade anymore due to the lack of damage output per second and squishyness it has, it becomes impossible to play in anything outside of 1v1. \n\nSuggestion 3 (awakening and succession): Give a dp buff on block (+20dp)\nDetails: Compared to all the other shield classes guardian is the only one without a dp buff on block, while at the same time it has the longest animations, slowest animations and more static nature; which in theory would make sense for it to have a dp buff. The class used to be considered a tanky class, with a tankier block than others, however as the game has evolved the damage of other classes has increased affecting guardian greatly due to its slower more idle nature when dealing damage. The dp buff would hopefully allow it the extra time to get off the damage before being blown up (which is the current case).\n\nSuggestion 4 (succession): Make Prime: Mutilation FG throughout the whole skill        \nDetails: Currently when you use the skill, the cast of the skill becomes FG and everything after the cast is unprotected, this is bad in many ways. Firstly, the skill cannot be cancelled essentially locking you in the skills unprotected animation. Secondly, when using Prime: black blood slaughter after the Prime: Mutilation the unprotected animation is still kept between the flow into the second skill, which makes no sense. This causes the user A LOT of the time to be cc'd mid flow into the second skill. If Prime: Mutilation  was changed to FG throughout the skill then this would fix the gap between the flow into the second skill, creating a massive quality of life improvement. You shouldn't be punished for using a skill and then being animation locked in the unprotected animation or cc'd in a gap that cannot be averted which is further emphasised by the slowness of the class. \n\nSuggestion 5 (Awakening): Allow for pre-awakening grab to be used in awakening stance from hotbar\nDetails: As the new awakening grab change makes it more ranged it would be nice to see a quality of life improvement for the pre-awakening grab, whereby the pre-awakening grab can be used from awakening. As it currently stands, if the opponent sees the guardian in pre awakening they need not be in fear of being grabbed due to the restrictive nature of the grab only being accessible in pre-awakening. If this means increasing the cooldown of the grab then that is perfectly reasonable. \n\nSuggestion 6 (Succession): When in q block, it is not possible to cast a number of skills while being hit\nDetails: When in q block and being hit by an enemy, succ guardian is unable to cast a number of succession skills UNLESS USED FROM HOTBAR. This fundamentally doesn't make sense as if the skills were not usuable while being hit they would not be usable from hotbar. This causes a lot of issues in group fights as u can only use around 3-4 skills from hotbar while being hit in block and the rest can ONLY be used after using fierce distain or infernal nemsis to stop the hits before using a skill such as S+LMB as normal. Please change it so all skills can be used as normal when you are being hit in q block.  PS. ITS IMPORTANT TO MENTION THIS ONLY OCCURS WHEN THE ACTUAL BLOCK IS HIT CAUSING A STAGGER AND NOT THE BACK OF THE GUARDIAN (THE SUPER ARMOR AREA)"

Nerf Protections on all Super Armor classes. Turn some of those Super Armors into Forward Guards. Nerf the Protections to make it fair for classes with no grabs. Turn some Super Armor skills into Forward Guard skills for classes that can stay in SuperArmor all the time during their damage combo. This applies for all SuperArmor classes.2. Reduce damage on certain classes and bring back having to combo people to kill. Certain classes like Succession DK, Succession Ranger, Awakening Musa and more can kill players in a single KD and sometimes even standing. Succession DK is of course the most extreme one out of all of these. Nerf the damage on some of these classes. Also consider nerfing the Succession Ninja class buff for AoS purposes mainly, but also applies for other types of PvP (open world and gear capped PvP). Make it so it does less DOTS damage either by changing the damage number on the DOTS or by removing 1-2 out of the 3 Bleed/Poison/Burn debuffs. \n3. Keep up the good work by reducing the amount of slow debuffs in the game\n\nAwakening Striker\n> Nerf the KD Grab. KD > Bound\n> Remove 10% Down Attack Modifier from Autumn Blaze to reduce damage across the board since Autumn Blaze is used at the start of a damage combo\n\n> Savage Somersault. SuperArmor > ForwardGuard\n\n> Make Grabs SuperArmor on successful catches again. Remove the unprotected time that lasts for around half a second after getting a successful grab and revert it to what it was before the classes rework so you don't get cc'd trying to peel for your teammates. Because of the different ping between players, you can still get cc'd even if you are in the SuperArmor portion of the grab on your screen, but will be unprotected from the enemy player's perspective."

Either bring it back to the pre-reboot state, fix it or remove it from the game. It doesn't serve any purpose right now, besides enabling usage of the absorb buff once per 5m30s. Majority of the tamers distrust the developers to do the good job working with the heilang AI so much, it might be for the best to go for the latest, then bring the heilang-less tamer to the power level of the other classes.\n 2. [Awakening] Fix the cloud ride\nYou go downhill it gets distrupted by the falling animation. You get vaccumed it gets distrupted by the falling animation. You get hit stutter animation mid-air it gets distrupted by the falling animation. You go uphill you travel no distance. Make it work, and if you can't, then go the easy way and put i-frame on the airborne part of the skill, like you did with the guardian.\n 3. [Awakening] AoE needs to get adjusted\nAt least a little bit. Because of that, it's lackluster in PvE.\n 4. [Awakening/Succession] Decide on what tamer is supposed to be\nMain passive is 5% accuracy, although tamer has magic damage, so it's terrible against the main benefactors of the evasion builds(strikers and mystics). Fortune blessing is 50hp and 25lt - base hp is very low, and 25lt makes zero sense. Then succession has 250hp and 5ap - it's decent, but once again, low base hp. Lets look at the buffs: berserk gives 20dp, 15% movement speed and 30% all resistance. Succession has only 20% of all resistance, but 15% evasion, yet it's useless because tamer doesn't work with evasion build. Absorb buff gives once per 5m30s 10 ap, 8dp, 20% speed and 60% crit rate, also for the party. And there is a heilang, that basically does nothing since the reboot.\n\nYet, it can't deal well with evasion strikers and mystics, which are like 90% of the evasion users, despite passives and buffs it's not tanky at all, party buff doesn't turn tamer into a good support either, because of the low uptime of the buff(30s/330s). It's not a summoner class, because it doesn't use summon at all(because it's bugged since 10 months). My point is, looking at the rest of the kit, in the current state tamer is not even a jack of all trades, it's jack of no trades. Think some more about overall design of the class. Latest attempts with \n 5. [Succession] Succession needs some counter versus pressuring opponents\nSuccession has a serious flaw, that is reliance on the WW iframe that has relatively large gap in it. In 6 seconds(tree climb cooldown) you can cancel it like three times, then you have to either stop moving and use protected skills, or use evasion 4-5 times with a gap - it's extremely unreliable. Pre-reboot it was offset to some point by the fact that heilang traps(roaring and void) were actually working reliably and people weren't in perma SA. Either one of this has to be done:\n- Replace Prime: Allround Spiner(basically S-block with a cooldown and timer) with actual S-block and either Prime: Leaves Dropping or Prime: Cloud Stomping(but fix it finally!!!!),\n- Close the gap on evasion for a succession tamer with a FG or SA,\n- Make tamer so strong, that it can stop moving to face the opponents in damage trade\n 6.

        "content": "Family Name: Heddwch\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): General Balance Issues\n\nSorry that this isn’t really the intended format, but I believe the biggest issues facing balance aren’t related to a single class or a single ability, a lot of them are systemic across how Pearl Abyss attempts to balance BDO, and to keep things brief here are 5.\n\nSuggestion: More frequent and smaller class balance changes\nDetails: For some reason PA has historically focussed on giant “class balance patch” where they do huge sweeping changes to many classes. While at times this does need to happen (a great example was the ~2017 class balance patch, where excess protections and cc’s were removed from all classes), it would be much better if PA was willing to do much more frequent but smaller incremental changes to tune balance.\n\nSuggestion: Remove RNG Resist\nDetails:  CC resistances shouldn’t work in pvp. We have provided this feedback for years so if we must have rng resistance in pvp then at least make them even less effective (such as not being able to resist a re-cc while already CC’ed).\n\nSuggestion: Adjust Class tankiness and damage output\nDetails: Currently BDO has really big issues in the balance between tankiness and damage output where many tanky classes do not give up any damage for their extra tankiness. This issue is exacerbated in capped forms of pvp content such as Arena of Solare, and T1 Node wars. Ideally this would be done by removing some of the damage output from offending classes, making it more difficult to run hybrid builds while still being able to one combo other classes.\n\nSuggestion: Reduce variance of class modifiers\nDetails: Right now several classes have far too much variance in their class modifiers making it harder to balance their damage output. There is no reason why any class should do 30% more damage to Class A than to Class B, and having a more consistant damage output will make it much easier to properly balance the damage output of each class.\n\nSuggestion: Be more willing to nerf classes\nDetails: Right now more than ever we are in desperate need of nerfs across the board to protections/cc’s. I understand there will be backlash, but pvp was much more fun when classes were at a lower power level. Of course this is all on PA to decide what power level they are trying to balance the classes to, as while I may have enjoyed the playstyle of having weaknesses and needing to outplay, there may be people who prefer just rotating protections until someone gets desynced out of a protection or is grabbed. Even at the existing power level there are many classes that need a nerf, and instead of just restating it I will just direct you to really consider Armin's posts on specific nerfs for several problematic classes (such as Awak Musa, Succ DK, and Succ Ninja) on page 5 and 25.There are many more issues worth looking into, such as: The countless bugs for numerous classes such as tamers pet, V not working in certain situations such as KD's or when your grabbed by a class with a long grab animation, the existence of KD grabs, the existence of ranged grabs which get buffed to 15 seconds cd (the minimum of grabs post rework), the disparity in utility available to different classes, and the significant differences in pve efficiency between classes. However many of these have been detailed by other users' posts, so I will leave it at that.Thank you for your time and feel free to reach out!"

Stamina issues have been a problem for the class overall since the nerfs went through a few months back (in both PvE and PvP), but the balance patches that have addressed it have focused almost entirely on PvE (with the most recent giving Prime: Shackles a cancel, and Fatal Blow doing more damage overall) while ignoring her 1v1 PvP stamina issues. In group based PvP (node wars, AoS, guild vs guild, RBF etc) her stamina issues can be mitigated by her ability to disengage from a fight using her mobility or stealth while her team continues staying in the engagement, but for 1v1s specifically once she reaches 0 stamina, she loses. Giving her stamina regeneration on Prime: Flash Slash, or on Prime: Tendon Cutter would mean she'd still rely on stamina mangement, but she would have a far easier time staying in an engagement, or regenerating her stamina with super armor throughout a fight or once it's become critically low. Giving her stamina regeneration on both skills however would in my opinion make her overpowered."

        "content": "Family Name: SeitzRegion: NAClass: Succession KunoichiSuggestion: Soften the stamina nerfs on succession kunoDetails: Succession kuno's stamina changes were meant to reduce the mobility and turn the class into more of a high risk high reward play style. Tendon cutter and flash slash are arguably succ kuno's most iconic skills which were nerfed with a high stamina cost and removal of stamina recovery. While succ kuno's damage was retained, with the current state of the game most classes have burst potential and high damage. This results in succ kuno needing to pick fights carefully to perform on equal grounds with other classes. My suggestion is to reduce the stamina cost of tendon cutter or provide some safer options for recovering stamina (enable stamina recovery on flash slash or remove stamina drainage on block). This would continue to force kuno's to pick fights carefully while allowing them to disengage and re-engage in a timely manner.\n\nOther wish list items:\n-Change the input for prime: shakles (shift c) since kunos are often sprinting and the input for prime: danse (forward c) causes use of shackles instead of danse. Or allow kuno's to lock the skill and still retain the animation cancel when comboing with other skills (skill -> hotkey)"

        "content": "Family Name: ReziaRegion: NAClass: Awakening RangerSuggestion: Awakening Ranger PvE Improvements and PvP QoLDetails: Awakened Ranger has never been a meta grind class, and it doesn't need to be. It has its niche as one of the stronger duelists. Rangers lack of mobility makes its pack to pack very inneffecient, but is unable to bring the consistent damage that it should in return. Rangers long cd's make infinite comboing a hassle, where you are often forced to use low damage filler skills.Lowering the cooldown of Regeneration and Nature's Tremble from 12s to 10s should allow it to form some semblence of an infinite combo, which any decent grinder is capable of. Right now, Ranger burns all of its skills just to kill one pack, as its PvE damage is lower than other classes.PvE Damage and AOE buffs to Cold Blade would also make it viable. Cold blades only current use is the accuracy buff for PvP combos, and currently does less damage than some classes basic left click attacks. Increasing the AoE and damage of this skill would make it more than just an accuracy buff, as it feels like wasting time to use it.Damage buffs to to Flow: Disillusion and making it hotbar available, making it not feel like a useless skill. Flow: Disillusion is a low damage unprotected float, connected to a unprotected KD ability. Flow: Disillusion having downsmash makes it completely pointless in PvP, as you'd be using it just after a KD, and would ruin almost any combo. Allowing this to be hotbarred would make it useable it PvP as a downsmash combo ender. And as a flow, I think its damage should reflect the commitment. It's an unprotected skill with the same cast time as Elven Rage, and should do similar damage, at least in PvE.\n\nIn Reboot, we were given the skill Guardian Wind, a long range unprotected stiffen. While the concept is alright, seeing as how a ranger should have range. However, the skills animation lock makes it unable to be chained into any protected skill, forcing a massive gap for a stiffen, which would rarely be able to be followed up because of this animation lock. Allowing it to be canceled and removing the requirement of mobility skills to cast, would make it viable all around. A range stiffen with a small gap, and in PvE, a skill to add into your comboI don't think all of these changes need to be added, but one or two changes of something similar to whats written above would increase the QoL of the class, as well as help it reach middle tiers in PvE, where it struggles most. It doesn't need to be a top grind class, but I'd like the potential to at least pull average numbers in PvE with average gear."

Although I think the class may be too powerful with an iframe > SA on evasion, I think the fact the class takes so much damage in super armor would mitigate it's ability to endlessly iframe while allowing it to reposition safely after a cc lands. I don't believe super armor on Prime: Lightning of Earth would be overpowered however seeing as many other classes have protected knockdowns, and giving her one protected down cc outside of her grab would help her tremendously in the current meta while maintaining the power the grab possesses, and the balancing around it."

        "content": "Family Name: VikThory\nRegion: EU\nClass: Musa (Awakening)\nSuggestion: some changes on musa,  mobility changes, fix the 1shot meta, AoS\nDetails: So I hear many ppl complaining about musa having infinite SA rotation. Do you want to know the secret of beating a musa? Just slow or grab him.  Around 3/4 of the classes have grab which pierces SA and also most of the classes have slows which fk up the musa and not to mention the SA + FG blocks. If you dodge the grab or resist it though some of the classes have +30% grapple success rate passive the chances are that the opponent has one more grab or in the best case you have 15 secs to outplay them. Yeah musa is good when it comes to mobility, but you can't actually convince me that he is the best when there are zerkers running faster than horses with infinite stamina. Musa has relatively high dmg yeah, but let's not forget we play in 1shot meta for a while so it doesn't really matter.\nAnother problem that is concerning not only Musas is the terrain issue. This may be a trivial problem at 1st, but if you enjoy playing AoS let's say and you get the lovely manshaum forest map and they have sth that can atk from the rocks or another high ground you will have to go around or climb. And this leads to another problem I would like to mention - the AoS maps which became very unbalanced since the addition of those balls. If you get knocked down,grabbed or cced and you are in the ,,red circle'' of the ball then ... congratulations, you are dead! Not to mention the AoS crashing nonstop even though most ppl play it just for the weekly.\nSo in conclusion I think that the mobility in the game has to be reviewed. I think that there should be a limit of -40% movement speed reduction. I also believe that every class should have one skill with relatively high cd that gives them +50% grapple resistance for a short duration or just change/nerf the passive +30% grapple success rate of the classes that already have it.\nI would suggest buffing the scaling of DP and DR to extent that every class will need their full combo to kill their opponent, cuz as it is now the person who is cced/grabbed 1st loses. I also suggest removing the class vs class modifiers. They make the game even harder to balance. Also those successions are needless. Just combine some of the succ ideas with pre awakenings of the characters and you are good to go. That way the pre awakenings will be useful again.\nChanges:\n1. Awakening\nFlow: Dash Slash - higher cd ( 5s -> 6s )\nSearing slam - add movement speed -15%, higher cd ( 6s -> 7s ) \nCrust crusher - dealing a little bit higher dmg and having higher cd ( 12s -> 16s last rank ), Movement speed -15% removed\nProjection - add FG and remove floating, higher cd ( 7s -> 9s ) \nExtra credit - remove stiffness\nInferno slash - add FG or speed it up a little bit, damage reduction in pvp greatly increased, higher cd 10s->13s ( This skill is unprotected and is used in pve mainly, but even mobs catch the gap. I suggest the written above changes to the skill so it can be used only in pve.)\n2. Pre awakening\nRetaliation - remove knockdown and instead add stiffness\nRetaliation: Decapitation -> add knockdown and reduce cd to 30s ( this skill is unprotected, has 50s cd and deals no dmg and no cc as it is now there is no reason to use it )\nMusa's spirit - Recover 200 WP  -> Recover 350 WP at last rank ( Nowadays you can have 450-500 WP at least as a musa and this skill imo is simply outdated it won't give any big buff to musa neither in pvp nor in pve just for comfort )\nUltimate Musa Spirit - now cleanses all debuffs, higher cd 20s -> 90s, , recover hp 450->500 ( I took the idea Quoratum's guard which is nova's skill, but my thing won't be protected and won't give as many buffs as hers and will have halved cd )\nRising storm - add FG ( not very important )\nArrow grapple -add FG increase the cd to 15s ( This 10s cd skill at last rank and is used just for fun, but it can be made useful very easily. As it is now it deals no dmg, no protection, but has a stun. You literally have to go in the enemy's face which is two edged sword literally )\nStorm Slash - add FG ( Many characters have some bad Skill enchantment options and I agree with ppl who say that those skill enchantment options should be changed )\nLastly if possible add more skills to use on Tiger Blade and increase it's cd to 3mins."

        "content": "Family Name: DreadsparkRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Shai - TalentSuggestion: Full Class Rework + Dream Donkey & Krogdalo Change\nDetails:\n       >  History - Since Reworks, Shais have become the weakest and most vulnerable class in PvP with both AP and DP sets. (Yes she does provide Sun Moon Stars in PvP and I get that most of you would gladly streak across the battlefield for a Shai who slaves away at pressing that one button but this is a holistic view.) They are the most difficult classes in the game to play in small-scale PvP and Arena of Solare at the date of this posting. These stats are corroborated through discussions across NA/EU regions via the class discords, and Twitch discussions where it is often said that to have a Shai on your team is to assume a loss unless they are 1 of a few named individuals. You shouldn't have to be an Armin of Shais just to PvP at a base level.\n\nRecently, PA and the Devs have seen fit to reduce the potency of Shai because players abuse of the hits per attack and single i-frame mobility of the kit to grind end-game content with nearly beginner gear. When the loss of Misty Haze nerf to a 3min CD is factored in then it can undoubtedly be said that Shai will have been more capable Pre-Rework than Post-Rework, which should be grounds for a new rework that fixes the design issues without faulting the players.\n\nAdditionally. PA still refuses to give the Shai community back their Dream Donkey and Ignored a Feedback form that the NA Shai Community created to try and address PvP-related issues. That form can be found here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0GHIPJ-ssM3m11HBQZ2Qa6m0PcSaBRxRmF0NqcVt6A/edit?usp=sharing\n\nShais are bullied mercilessly by other players and those of us with gear, are seeing our communities slowly dwindle and die due to lack of early game support. As well as the fact that there is no late game vision/purpose beyond buff spam.\n\n       >  Request - PA needs to rework Shais support, Rework her PvE combat style, and rework her PvP so they can remove obstacles for grind zone design teams and resolve the class identity which prevents it from being effective in a range of content such as PvP & PvE. If a full rework is not possible then I would like to suggest that they divide the class into Awakening (DP/Eva/Support/Life Skill) and Succession (AP/DR/DPS) much as they did for Nova.\n\nI wish the best for this game and the Devs and I hope they know this is simply a method for delivering some perspective on what we Shais think about the class. We want the fun culture stuff like music, life skills, and donkeys, we want to have some way to defend spots or play as AP, and we would like the option to forgo AP to play as a DP Support. However, when boolied to the edge, the shai community can be really destructive which is not a good place to be. Please don't push us into the corner with all these nerfs; I'm certain if PA looked at the class and it's sacrifices as a whole then you'll notice we are actually in dire need of help.\n\n       >  Donkey Krogdalo - The life skill buff applied as a spacebar skill should apply to party members regardless of whether they're out at sea on barters or in pilgrims' haven mining or south of Velia gathering wolf meat. Almost all life skill spots are made only for solo, and therefore it should apply to the entire party as long as they're on the same server. This set of gear takes the most time of all the Krogdalo sets to get. It is made wholly ineffective by the range of the buff. Going beyond that point, it honestly should be considerably more powerful for stats like movement speed, turning, etc. when used by a Shai. This should be similar to an Artina Sol and receive these stats for their mount as a Class bonus which all Shais should want to get for their Donkey frens (Perhaps even make the act of obtaining Donkey Krogdalo and V Artina Sol part of making their donkey a dream mount). This type of culture fluff is fun and helps bring in players who like to enjoy the RP side of this class such as the music composition.\n\n       >  Music Composition - should allow you to play in more than just a 5man party. Many songs made by composers require 7 or more Shais. If we make a platoon, then let us play the songs with more instruments.\n\nMuch love to everyone, I have decided to remove myself from content where I would in the foreseeable future be regulated into a role that would have my most effective playstyle regulated to repeatedly pressing 1 button (SMS) like a trained animal. ♥"

However, now we can barely stay in a sustained fight for more than 15 seconds. I would have no issue with this if we could actually use our S or Q block after the fight, but since it uses stam whenever the block is hit, it is not an option. I'd like it if stam consumption on S/Q block is removed so we have some form of proper protection when sitting outside the fight or getting chased. Some people may say to just go invisible, but moving in invis also drains stam, so if you leave a fight with 5 stam left and then go invisible, its super easy to get caught since I basically have to stand still, and its not like we have a SA rotation either to sit protected in.\nsucc kuno after the nerfs the class is unfun to play and not enjoyable at all"

        "content": "Family Name: YomitsuRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakened MysticSuggestion: Skill Comboing Fluidity and DesignDetails:\nWaveOrb: My bigest concern, one of awakenings bread and butter transitions is to cancel into wave orb from pre awakening, usually from roaring tiger. as it is currently, doing so locks the direction of the skill to go off in the direction of the previously used pre awakened skill. this causes issues when chasing with side dashes  to wave orb, and many other instance where you need to turn quickly and reach out to apply the slow. Aditionally the skill seems to have slow pauses it did not previously have, which actually slow down moving into combo's when exiting the pre awakened half of the kit, resulting in a clunkiness that was not present prior to rework, and is not present in the succession kit. successions wave orb is an excelent model of how the skill should feel when it goes off in any circumstance.Double Flash- double flash sounded great on paper, however being forced into awakening causes alot of clunky ungainly and disorienting situations due to it being hard to track in a high speed inviroment such as pvp. majority of awakenings protections, catches and debuffs are performed from pre awakened stance, so being forced into awakening when chasing or running causes alot of issues tactically. currently it overwhelmingly makes more sense to leave it locked then try to use it. the choice to design it this way i find to be curious, because for years we asked for Wolf Frenzy not to force a stance swap, and ya'll finally did it with rework, but incluced a skill that forced it on just dashing around. either way, dashing is not a skill we want to be stance forced during. its clunky and weird, interupts how combat and the class flows mechanically.Rework skills when rework came in, the damage of seaburial and wave orb was sunk way down in pvp, and several new skills were added in. leaving the assumption that the damage was adjusted to account for the addition of new skills being added. however, the class didnt get any faster, and transitions  between the new skills and existing skills borderline on being clunky, which resulted in an overall net drop in damage in pvp. i gained 3 ap brackets since rework, and only now do i feel like my total damage output is on par with where it was before the rework. further, many of the newer skills had downsmashes on them, making their placement in various parts of a combo super limited as they could potentially end a combo almost the moment it is used, especially since in most cases a downsmash duration is over by the time you can que up the next downsmash skill due to combo flow and attack speed limitations. Earth splitter- neat skill, hard to really understand where it fits best in a combo, as the animation is long enough that a downsmashed target can usually stand up by the time you are out of the animation. the heal on it hardly justifies this limitation, and the pvp damage reduction is high enough that it makes more sense to stick to using more traditional combo options over it than risk the downsmash. visually lack luster, clunky, not enough pros to outweigh the cons.Raging Wind and Dragon Strike - great step in the right direction, still takes up alot of time to do without contributing enought to the output to keep the class on par with other class's, not to mention the downsmashes that end combo's.Overall class Design and Balancing:Some of the more recent damage modifications also lead me to believe that alot of the skill balancing around seaburial and wave orb was balanced around the maximum outputs of the skill- using shards to empower the attack with Banha. This approach makes sense- if the attacks produced a dragon every time they were used. however the dragon summoning is gated behind martial shard usage, which limits the dragon from being used in a combo more than once in most cases.  i would like to point out that Striker, the Mystics brother of a class, does not have this limitation, as the clones attack on every use of a skill that summons them. i would also like to point out that one of the more popular aspects of mystic on BDO mobile is that the dragons are not shard gated. it is a shame that the class isnt more like the more popular mobile version of the class.Grab- the least popular on the mystic topicVerifiably, the grab gap has a measurable gap of roughly a third of a second, during which the mystic is simply standing there. previously it was an SA, which was widely complained about by the player base for a very long time. And quite honestly, i dont mind that it was a change that was implemented, but what i dont like is how non universal the flaws in their grab are. Valkarie and Warrior for example, are actually still tool tipped to have an instant cast grab, meaning that their grab is just as protected if not more so than striker and mystics grabs were before the SA was removed. currently in pvp, there is a HUGE over reliance of grabs on classes with kits that are more than capable of scoring CC's in other ways than just grabs. it is also worth noting that classes with more than one grab generally were unaffected by the nerf to grab CD.i'm not saying i want a protected grab, but i would like to see grab flaws be treated more universally and fairly amongst all the classes. The Wrap UpClasses with resources that gate damage are generally inefficient and less fun. having a resource for other mechanics however, are significantly more fun. And not getting actual verifiable bugs in a class that persist for over half a year even after reporting is generally also considered fun. As other Awakened mystics have stated here before- we would like a proper rework that results in a playable class, that captures the spirit and feel of the origional class while improving on the design, without taking away from the mechanical feel. Which according to most of the rework interviews was the origional goal and intent. we would just like to see a follow through on a promis so that we can go back to playing the game we love the way we loved to play it."

        "content": "Family Name: AcarnRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Berserker AwakeningSuggestion: Quality of life changes & General Balance ChangesDetails: I think Berserker awakening is in a solid spot, and doesn't need many positive changes to adjust its power currently, however there are some quality of life changes that I think would benefit the class without improving its overall power too much. The strength of the class currently is in the burst damage available with many knockdowns available, and its kiting ability. Each class should have its strengths and weaknesses, and Berserker's strengths are great right now, they don't need much changing. That being said, there are lots of gaps in how some skills connect to each other currently, which can be quite frustrating with the server desync that is prevelent. The following suggestions have been ranked top to bottom for importance in their respective specs (mainhand/awakening).\n\nMainhand:\n\n- Ultimate: Evasion: this skill could do with gaining some form of protection on a cooldown. I think this getting an i-frame on a 4/5second cooldown would be ideal, but having it as a 4 second super armour would also work to connect some of our skills a bit smoother in a protected manner. HANDS DOWN THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE.\n\n- Absolute: Predatory Hunt: this skill is kind of hard to use in its current state for 3 main reasons - how easy it is to grab, the fact that it gets affected by hitstun, and that it generally doesn't flow out of anything meaningful. I think that the risk vs reward of not being able to easily cancel it and thus being at such a large risk to grabs is great. I don't want that to change at all. However, I think that hitstun is in general a very bad mechanic and makes skills like this unusable at times and even that isn't my main problem with the skill. I'd like to see it be usable on c-swapping from awakening to pre-awakening to give the swap a form of protection and to also fill in some of the gaps in our extended SA rotations.\n\n- Absolute: Frenzied Tyrant: pretty under-utilised skill on awakening outside of the black spirit rage version. The main reason being how soon the super armour ends. Even if you hold down the input for shake off, you often can't exit the skill before the protection ends while slowed and with server desync, you can get caught even if you do. Just extend the super armour by a small amount so that it can be consistently exited in protection.\n\n- Absolute: Raging Thunder: this is literally never used other than for the sideways version of the skill right now. I don't want us to get damage on this, other than maybe for PvE purposes however it would be nice if it could be cancelled faster in some way, whether with storming beast, headbutt, or the ending just being sped up.\n\nAwakening:\n\n- Flow: Ancient Wave: there is currently a major issue with this skill, being that the skill upon being fired cancels itself if you get cc'd. With desync playing a major role with this skill, it can be frustrating to use sometimes when it gets completely cancelled. A solution to this would be turning ancient wave into a summon. This would mean the skill doesn't get randomly cancelled once fired off.\n\n- Flamebuster & Titan Syndrome: the current titan syndrome + flamebuster combo people use is probably unintentional. Currently, we can only instantly fire charged flamebuster shots with level 1 flamebuster learned, and it stops working at level 2 & 3. Removing the knockdown on each hit was a great change for the game, however the lack of damage it offers now is super underwhelming. Change flamebuster to fire instantly on level 2 & 3 while Titan Syndrome is active, but keep the cc on hit how it is currently.\n\n- Blasting: hands the worst skill in the awakening kit as is. I've seen other suggestions to rework this skill into something else, but I think a better idea is to make it forward guard like the core and change blasting core for giant leap (give it bound on landing I guess).\n\n- Devastation & Earth Dividing: give this skill the same treatment as warrior's Gravedigging. Lower the slow to 10%/10%/10% and 5s on each. Not necessary for us to have these strong slows in our kit, they cover our weaknesses in a way that isn't needed in the kit. Slows are unhealthy as a whole right now and I hope that all of them get the same change.\n\n- Titan Blow: lower the damage of this skill in pvp slightly. This is a tradeoff that would be absolutely worth exchanging to fill some of the ever present gaps in every rotation we want to do.\n\n- Giant Leap: as nice as it would be to get split cooldown on each leap (getting back the flow: jump sequence essentially but having it activatable on its own), it's probably quite unnecessary and would be a bit overtuned for the kit. I'll still leave the option here as it is something a lot of us want.\n\n- Lastly, please buff our WP meter!"

Right now, most classes rely on trading damage while being protected and rotating their SAs to stay protected. Succ maehwa on the other hand, relies on kitting to survive and on cc'ing her target to deal some sort of damage, which means that most of her damage is gated behind combos, which are mostly unprotected and slow. These problems make it almost impossible for her to do anything in certain match-ups/situations. Possible Solutions: I'm not asking for all of these changes to go through, I'm just giving out ideas.

Almost unplayable. You can match someone in gear and either get out SA traded or just one shotted regardless. Just very unbalanced in my opinion.

        "content": "Family Name: Crimdragon\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Guardian\nSuggestion: Buffs to Awk and Succ to improve their performance in pvp\nDetails: \n\nAwakening\nAfter the reboot awakening guardian has become seriously outdated. Reboots were supposed to bring balance but instead it just created an even greater imbalance. A result of that imbalance has been awakening guardians becoming unplayable. In its current state awakening lacks damage to trade damage in fights. Awakening was known as an SA trading class yet now it can't even do that because it's slow and its attacks don't hit hard for today's standards. In addition to its lack of damage it is very predictable, it lacks really any outplay potential. Cleansing flame core right now is a must so I suggest giving it the float as default so it can open up the potential to use other core skills. Guardian also has lots of unusable skills in awk such as flow to ashes, scalding thorn, Dragon's maw, infernal steps, scornful slash (outside of 1v1 is unusable). Looking into changing these skills would give guardian more variety in its kit. Also give searing fang full SA as of right now it has SA on first hit then unprotected, same goes for the flow suppress. Makes the skill really unusable outside of comboing an already downed target in a 1v1 scenario.\n\nSuccession\nSuccession is in a better state than awakening but still has some issues. One of the glaring issues it has is the gap in mutilation. The gap has been the result of many unnecessary deaths for me and for what reason? There is no reason for there to be a gap in one of our main cc abilities. It is a foward guard yet you get cc out of it from the front more than the back. In a high mobility meta where a decent amount of class can get behind you before we even cast the full animation I don't see why they allow for this unjust and completely comical gap. Succession is very susceptible to getting pinned down and being forced to rely on holding block until it is eventually ran down and killed. It needs better mobility, and some cd reductions on mobility skills. Mountains echo is unnecessarily long cd for a skill that is very niche, Juggernaut cd in pre awakened is 12 sec vs 7 sec in awakened, why? Also the starting animation is too slow speeding it up would help improve it ( same goes for awk juggernaut). Reworking rockslide to be an actual usable mobility skill would help us as well. Succ has a lack of i frame which makes it easily punishable by grabs, improving the i frame on fierce disdain could fix that. This has been mentioned in a prior post by user Huunuras on page 13 with a good example but our grab range gets cut short when attacked by skills with multiple hits. This leads to it not landing and getting cc when it should have landed and giving us the protection.\n\nBoth specs\nIncreasing the duration of the attack speed buff for both awk and succ would help. In awk you usually run out of attack speed mid fight and you cannot reapply it since its unprotected. In succ our attack speed buff is on a skill we try and reserve for dodging\nBoth spec have problems with its getting cc out of i frame when slowed, this is not just a problem with guardian though. I have also had problems with succ drak's iframe, succ corsair, wizard tp and I am sure there are more.\nOur grab does not land when a target is using a no collision skill.  An example of this is Valkyrie's Sanctitas de Enslar (F jump skill). After they land they are in a no collision state thats SA yet we just go through them if we try and grab. This needs to be looked at and fixed"

The skill Lightning Blast is generally kept locked and used exclusively from hotbar. Having the keybinds unlocked is generally a hinderance. 1. The keybind RMB skill overlaps with a few aspects of the sideways and S + RMB Pet Stiffness. 2. Accomplishing the keybinds of Lightning Blast during Magical Evasion or after Magical Evasion or after Detonative Flow cuts the skill pattern to half (only 1 beam instead of 2) which is very rarely valuable. 3. It does not increase the activation speed anyways.\n\nMy suggestion would be inspired by the RMB keybind after Magical Evasion. It is very stylish to do the finger snapping (TM) after it. But, it doesn't really add anything in its current form. Why not just make the Witch snap her fingers during the Magical Evasion instead?It would result as such. A or D + RMB causes the Witch to do a sideways dash similar to the Magical Evasion. It does the two beams during the attack while in Frontal Guard (Or Super Armor); one beam during the hop and a second one upon landing smoothly. It would cause the same effects as Lightning Blast, but additionally, it would automatically triger the RMB Pet Stiffness command at the last beam, commanding the pet to launch its Stiffness Attack.Why? It would give Witch another needed mobility option, give her positive momentum in 1v1 by threatening unprotected movements from the enemy for a short duration due to the Pet Stiffness Command. It would also resolve a major Keybind overlap conflict by mashing both the Lightning Blast and Pet Stiffness Command together in a way that compliments both."

        "content": "Family Name: DespinsRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening WitchSuggestion: Repair Earth's CallingDetails: Earth's Calling is a new addition to the arsenal of the Awakening Witch since reboot. It has been a conflicting skill with an enigmatic usage. Initially, the skill was granting the Witch a 10% Critical Chance Buff for 10 seconds, but at the cost of having a similar buff removed from Yoke of Ordeal. The main concern was to Yoke of Ordeal becoming much less appealing. However, the Critical Chance Buff was a key component for making this skill a substantial unprotected \"1v1\" combo tool. Also, the newest addition before the launch of the reboot was the removal of that 10% Critical Chance Buff while a Downsmash was added. On that matter, it is imperative to state that the Downsmash addition was, in vast majority, treated as a detrimental effect. Why? Earth's Calling is not your average skill: it is a delayed attack skill. As such, it cannot be thrown down in hope to extend a combo due to that delay. It is generally used during a freeze where the delayed is very much valued, followed by Fissure Wave. However, this causes the combo to fail at a 30% chance due to the Downmash. Yes, a Downsmash means the combo failed: the aerial phase of Downsmash disables the Down Attacks and the target stands back up right afterward.Please, remove the Downsmash from Earth's Calling and consider giving it some extra utility for combo potential. Such as Critical Chance Buff or Minus DP Debuff, the latter would be a unique addition to Awakening Witch.In addition to the state issue, another big issue needs to be pointed up. The 30% Accuracy from the tooltip is faulty by an extremely large margin. Adequate and precise testing methods as reported previously indicates that the tooltip accuracy of 30% is in fact 5%. This is 600% off the mark. Given that the skill is slow on cast, unprotected, does not provide any CC potential, it seems to me that the 30% Accuracy was implemented in a very controlled manner to keep the skill on budget. It is a shame that the Accuracy is in fact 5% and not 30%.Please, fix Earth's Calling effect to properly match the 30% Accuracy tooltip. Another issue of Earth's Calling is that the skill generally feels unrewarding to cast due to all the stated issues: unhelpful/hindering Downsmash, gravely faulty Accuracy Rate, slow cast, unprotected, no special effects or debuff or CC. Shortly speaking, it's a VERY risky skill for very little reward."

My suggestion is to remove cc's on Prime: Fist Fury and add Super Armor to the skill while increasing the PvP damage, which is justified in my opinion, since the animation is fairy long and leaves u open for grabs or damage. Furthermore Prime: Wolf's Hunger could need a damage buff in form of increased pvp damage or discharge on hits. I'm making this suggestion because it is a skill that could potentially finish off fleeing players, like Musa/Maehwa/Zerker Players who dash away with a rather small potion of health left. The issue here is that the skill damage is so low, that it usually is not able to finish a player but leaves u in a (small) animation on the last hit, which makes it hard to catch up again."

        "content": "Family Name: TheFarPlaneRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession):  Lahn successionSuggestion: QoL and class designDetails: Reboot was supposed to be a way of fixing gaps and weakness from all the classes but succ lahn reboot was a shame, PA just adjusted some skill animations to be 0.5s faster, but not even close what we need.I don't ask for everything, just some ideas to improve lahn succ potential and performance:- Stamina consumption: Every flight and dash consumes 200-300 stamina, and we use 6 skills to get close to enemies when they are far away (or waste time to heal up when we are low), making us waste like 1500 1600 stamina to reach them, and only 600 stamina left to dash (200 stamina/ use) / iframe (200) to reposition ourselves / self buff ap/att. speed (100 stamina each) so basically 200 stamina left to fight, when other classes like striker, mystic, ninja, zerkers, warriors, valks etc can sprint / forward dash from point A to your possition and still have 50/100 stamina to fight you and chase their next player. Reduce stamina consumption from flights and dashes or give us more stamina as passive skills like ranger has.- Sacred dance unnecessary nerf: Somehow PA decided to nerf SDance KD for pvp when nobody asked because succ lahn had a really low performance on pvp at that moment and now is even worst with all the buffs to other classes, to the point you dont see a single succ lahn on AoS top 100. Also, from the 6 useful CCs succ lahn has, 4 are only the first hit, 2 of them unprotected and 3 of them are stiffness, with no grab, so we can't do sh*t vs Qblock classes or sorcs with a trillion iframes and SA lingerings to recover stamina.- Ap and attack speed buff skills: Those buffs should be at skills in the current skill rotation or combos, not at A/D lmb rmb unprotected, and also wasting stamina?? wtf? most of the classes have their self buffs on skills that they use as main rotations...- Barely no self buffs: Succ lahn only have ap/at.speed self buffs, 15 dp buff on a useless skill that nobody uses because is half unprotected (1 and 2 hits from a total of 4 are unprotected) and long animation. Succ lahn doesn't have critic self buff, or movement self buff (Q buff is a joke, 3% movement speed/att. speed buff and 250hp every 15s), no accuracy self buff, no critic / down attack / back attack damage buff, no evasion debuff (like awakening already had), no accuracy or attack speed debuff, only a 20 DP Debuff every 16s (salpuri), a +15 magic DP buff every 10s and a 12% evasion buff every 5s. So basically u cant debuff your enemy apart from -20 dp every 16s and a -10% movement speed on a landing skill that is the worst landing from all of them. They always buff awakening lahn that already has some enemy debuffs but always forget succ lahn.- Need more prime skills: Succ lahn only have 5-6 skills prime to rotate in pve/pvp ( even awakening guardian has more skills than succ lahn), it feels like PA already forgot that this class exist, because other classes like hash or archer recently got some new skills while succ lahn has to work with 5 skills.        For example: - Catasetum (shift rmb) doesn't have prime and it's a blocked skill that nobody uses, 774x3 damage input and unprotected. - Eye of the phoenix (space) 882x4 dmg, no pvp CC, unprotected, no prime... - Berated Ghost (shift lmb) no prime, 811x2 damage, no cc, unprotected, also blocked by the 100% of the succ lahn players. - Soul ascent (shift F) 991x1 5 hits, unprotected, stiffness first hit, also blocked by 100% of the players. - Wind Orchid (S+RMB) FG first hit, 1051 x1 first hit, 1051 x2 second hit, KD, really low melee range attack, 100% of the succ lahn player base have this skill blocked because f*cks up the combo, weird animation, really low dmg, like, what classes still have skills with 800 x3, 1000x2 damage and suuuuper slow animations?? classes like the succ guardian and awakening guardian are getting 3k buff damage on a single skill for pve... 3 times this succ lahn skills only as buffs, apart from their base skill damage that already have, some of them reaching 12-14k dmg in most of their skills... as i said, succ lahn is a forgotten class... - Bleeding hearts (S+C) this one has prime but is really useless because is a SA with no CC and low dmg 848x1 max 8 hits, only cc at pve, when most of the spots have immune mobs... maybe buff the pve or pvp dmg or both? - Also a w+c skill maybe? S+E? Shift+E? W+Q? no? oke i guess ^^!  This class has a huge potential, but she is just reduced to the same 4 skills over and over again... almost no changes on skill order from pve to pvp. We fight with a huge chain but we can't have a grab while other classes like awakening sage or awakening wizzard does have it... The hp sustain is almost non-existent because the skill that have hp recover per hit is never used because of long animation, so mobs kills you while you are healing up. This lack of hp recover + really low defenses makes this class almost unplayable at high end spots. Spots like calpheon elvia, hexe monastery etc are forbidden to this class because the skills are really slow and long to heal up, you die while trying to heal yourself with addons of hp recover per hit, the frontal block is weak as f*ck, we only have 2 FG and it's blown up with 3 hits... We need faster animations, more skill variety, more hp recover per hit, or change it from the actual skill to others, add self buffs in main skill rotation, give back the SD KD... PLEASE PA, you didn't touch succ lahn in 6 months, pls..."

        "content": "Family Name: NayeonsRegion (NA/EU): SEAClass (Awakening/Succession): Succession WarriorSuggestion: \n\nBlock Changes – Remove the increasing DP stacking on Q block and just add it as a primary buff. Currently we are given +5 dp per hit on our block which maxes out at 50. Given that the damage in game has increased make the stacking buff a permanent q block buff basically giving us 50+ dp (tone the dp buff to 20 for AOS for balance reasons) but keep the 20+ dp to allies.\n\nQ Cancels - Succession Warrior already has limited sideways movement we currently only have a 3.5 which in my opinion is too long of a cooldown making it 2.0 would be nice. This ability allows us to skirt around enemies and sometimes it doesn’t even work that well. Allow us to Q cancel most of the skills (Ground Smash, Spin Slash, Solar, Shield Strike and Pulverize) in any point of the animation similar to awakening with Q block allowing us to bait and be more reactive. I would also like to remind the developers that most of our prime skills right now can only be cancelled with our only precious iframe it sucks trying to cancel out of long animations by burning your only iframe.\n\nLack of Healing – In group fights we have decent SA damage meaning that we will be tanking a lot of the damage head on but sadly\nhaving no way to reliably get out hurts us a lot since most of our movement is unprotected, I will not be asking for protected movement since I feel like that would be too strong for our kit. I am asking for the opportunity to be able to come back right into battle after I manage to get out, currently Succession meditation only gives us 200 hp and has a very long cooldown, Pulverize gives us 400 which when used in group fights doesn’t actually heal you but makes you take more damage due to its long animation. Given that we stack hp for survivability sometimes its better to just die and suicide rather than surviving and healing since the time needed to heal up is the same as just dying and respawning back. Allow us to meditate off cooldown for WP in engage or something like a Succession Guardian’s Black Blood Circle\n\nLingering Crit – A bulk of succession damage ties into the lingering crit combo which for the entire damage sequence is unprotected it would be nice to have heavy strike as a frontal guard as this would also help us in the PVE aspect we currently only have 1 PVE FG and that is scars of dusk.\nAccuracy Issues – Succ Warrior accuracy is abysmal our largest hitting combo does absolutely no damage to evasion targets. Give Ground Slash and Heavy Strikes a 10% accuracy modifier.\n\nBlock Lock – When getting hit during block we get a stagger hit which doesn’t allow us to do anything during that frame. It would be nice if this was removed entirely, Awakening warrior doesn’t suffer from this during their block so it would be nice if succession also has it.\nShield Strike – currently only the 3rd hit of shield strike is being used just remove all the other hits and make it a flow on certain skills\nMeditation – allow the succession version of meditation to “shrug off” or remove debuffs on cooldown, due to our long animations any slow related debuff is heavily felt during combos we are not allowed to combo anyone even if we catch people while slowed we simply re cc them and slow and hope we catch them again on the next engage. You can also just reduce slows in general like what we did to awk warrior kekw.\n\nSuccession E buff – I honestly think we are the class that has the worst Ebuff it gives us evasion% and movement speed. As a DR class evasion% doesn’t work for us. The E buff DP doesn’t stack with our block so its useless. The movement speed given only works on one skill and that’s frenzied charge basically making 2 out of the buffs given by a buff useless meanwhile other classes completely change their playstyle when their E buff is on.  Give us a 15% Attack Speed buff and 20 ap. Keep the accuracy and resists. The attack speed buff and ap will also help us in the PVE aspect. If you want to keep in tone with the class having a higher dp bonus would be nice aslong as it stacks with the Q buff and increase the resists if you want us to tank more.\n\nQuality of Life Changes – Allow Tremor to climb terrain according to its jump height. Better Hit Registration on Scars of Dusk currently we need to be extremely close to the target to deal any kind of damage, Scars already being a shit skill please give it more leeway. Fix Solar Flare hit registration hitting solar from max range does not stiff opponents."

        "content": "Family Name: Zeciarz\nRegion: EU\nClass: Tamer, Awakening\nSuggestion:\n\nOverall Changes:\n1. Change the knockdown effect of Ranger's awakening grab, Striker's pre-awakening grab and Mystic's grab to a bound or a float\n2. Nerf Marking Reagent\n3. Rework the Emergency Escape skill\n4. Reduce the amount of protection/protected CCs in the game\n\nTamer Changes:\n5. Increase the PVP damage of Allround Spinner or just rework it completely \n6. Replace Core: Echo Pierce with Core: Celestial Slam\n7. Remove the Down Smash effect from the Celesial Slam skill\n8. Fortune Blessing: replace the weight limit to 10% movement speed or just make it somewhat impactful\n9. Rework Heilang: Berserk\n10. Increase the AoE of certain skills\n11. Give Resonance 50% critical hit rate in both aspects of the game\n12. FIX HEILANG\n13. Fix Cloud Stomping\nDetails:\n1. Given the current state of the meta, trading in Super Armor is a common strategy due to the surplus of protected skills on all classes, therefore grapple skills are the most valuable form of CC. Since you are unable to V during the most part of a knockdown, just after your character hits the ground, grabs with a knockdown are extremely powerful and perhaps way too strong, especially in Arena of Solare.\n2. Marking Reagent is one of the most ridiculous item mechanics in the game. Not only it counters any type of stealth in the game, it also allows people to track people in V because their location is always shown on the minimap during the duration of Marking Reagent. The only way to counter this bullshit mechanic is either by going to character selection or by just waiting for the effect to run out. The most insane part of this item is that you can cast it on a dead body and the effects will linger throughout the entire duration of its effect.\n3. Emergency Escape is bad. During a guild war pets can track your location and ping in whichever direction you are going. The recovery state after getting out of V is just lethal to your character. You also should be able to move out of Berseker's grabs once you press V.\n4. 2018 treatment once again, please. The amount of protection in this game makes the game less skilled, more gear dependent and also less fun.\n5. Increasing the damage on this skill would hopefully help Tamer in group fights and currently the skill deals almost no damage despite a long animation, 70% reduction rate in PVP is just too much.\n6. Core: Echo Pierce is argubly the worst Core skill for Tamer. Replacing it with Core: Celestial Slam would make Tamer somewhat less grab-dependent, enable Tamer to have some decent trade ability and make the skill less risky since its animation cannot be cancelled.\n7. Celestial Slam does decent damage, especially with its air attack, but the down smash often messes up the combo during a knockdown, removing the down smash would certainly help.\n8. Most classes have some sort of useful class passive that gives them attack/casting speed, movement speed, AP, stamina, resistances, ignore resistances, crit rate, DP or HP, or really anything useful. Tamer just gains a bit of HP and weight limit. It would be nice if Fortune Blessing provided something useful like movement speed, attack speed or really anything better than the current state.\n9. Tamer's E buff is argubly the worst E buff in the game. Some people would argue that Tamer still has her Absorb Heilang and that it is a party buff, which is a valid point. The issue with Absorb is that its cooldown is 5:30. Every 5 minutes Tamer is able to get an offensive buff that enhances the character in the right way, meanwhile both the awakening buff and the succession buff are just there, not really providing Tamer with anything useful besides the movement speed buff. You could maybe rework the E buff to either give some offensive stats or just make Tamer's E buff similar to awakening Witch's E buff, which also applies to allies, give it Absorb stats and delete Absorb from the game.\n10. PVE would certainly feel less awkward.\n11. Again, it would allow Tamer to get some decent trading power.\n12. Enough research about the pet has already been provided to you, the AI of the pet is straight up broken and those issues desperately need to be fixed. Also fix tripple stiffness from Void Lighting.\n13. Inconsistency at its best. Landing on top of people, accelerating due to incoming damage, falling animation, there is just too much stuff going south in some cases. Skill has to be addressed in some way. Abilities that function similarly to Cloud Stomping, whether it's Berserker's Giant Leap or Guardian's Infernal Nemesis just work better, more consistent."

This seems like a bug since Smokescreen is designed to be used after any other skill ninja has.\n \n-When using Prime: Shadow Slash into Ankle Cutter, using Prime: Shadow Slash to the left will not animation cancel consistently into Ankle Cutter on the first hit. Inversely, using Prime: Shadow Slash to the right will not animation cancel Ankle Cutter on the 2nd hit. This is not very intuitive in the way it works and should be consistent in how the 2 skills interact, regardless of whichever directional attacks are made.\n\n\n\nQuality of Life Changes\n-When grinding, more often than not when using Prime: Fox Claw into Prime: Beheading the Dead using the RMB flow, you can get an unintentional Alert Stance, especially with higher attack speeds. This will cancel the 2nd hit of Beheading the Dead, reducing the overall damage potential while grinding. My suggested fix would be a similar treatment to what Prime: Blade Spin and Smokescreen had pre-reboot. Make it so you can't accidentally get Alert Stance by holding RMB down, requiring a 2nd RMB input while Prime: Beheading the Dead is being cast to get Alert Stance.\n \n-When trying to use any skill with either an LMB or RMB input after Prime: Fatal Blow (i.e. Red Rain, Ankle Cutter, Shadow Slash, Fox Claw, etc), you get Flow: Fatal Blow instead of the skill you input. Changing it have the skill you input override Flow: Fatal Blow would feel more cohesive to play instead of making those select followups out of Prime: Fatal Blow not possible."

        "content": "Family Name: PKBWGSCRegion (NA/EU): NAClass : Awakening WarriorSuggestion: Warrior buffs :)\nWarrior is very powerful as a engager in Arena of Solare, in fact I would argue it is the BEST at rushing the opponents at fast speed... but that is it, it burns bright but burns out quick, it has 3 super armor damage trade moves, it has GraveDigging, Slashing of the dead, and ground smash. This is perfectly fine, in all honesty I believe warrior job is to catch the opponent and open a window for your team and let them do the work on damage. However the problem comes after that, in the current state of the game if a warrior is on the backfoot and is being hunted or pressured, it has to rely on unprotected moves and frontal movement to escape. First the warrior will have to break distance from the foe with its 1 iframe, *HEAD CHASE* then hold Q block*Greatsword Defense* for the CD of Headchase to come back, then finally use *Charging thrust* to finally break enough distance to safety, However most the time the warrior will never break enough distance from the fight to even use Charging thrust to run. The downtime between iframes allows most classes with grab to punish warrior, or if his block is breaking he is forced to use unprotected movement to break distance from the aggressor due to the danger of the debuff if the block is truly broken. This has the added risk of being cced in the middle of *SOLAR FLARE* (This happens because the warrior used a unprotected Head Chase). The only way this can be saved in the current game is by investing into *Core Solar Flare* but this hurts warrior offensive play making potential, by removing the choice of a protected ReCC from its kit *CORE Pulverize and Core Grave Digging*\nSo I Suggest a buff to warrior's escape.\n\nIn my opinon, Warrior needs to get a flow skill connected to Head Chase and have it on a seperate cooldown, this flow would allow warrior to dash again quickly but with Super Armor, but after that it would be the same as the current head chase with no protection on CD. For the CD timer I suggest 5-8 seconds, this way you can not just loop between Iframe into SA permanently and is still required to sit still for a bit to allow counter play. This would allow the warrior to dash 2 times in quick succession to break distance from the fight quickly and then escape with the risky frontal guard move (I say risky because the warrior's back is exposed and can be CCd from range and slows).Or by making solar flare core a default part of the kit by giving it SA but removing Stiff from it.\nIf this change goes through we would need to add a new CORE skill, *CORE SA Flow Reckless Blow* (maybe) or we can just make the *Core Solar Flare* a stiff, basically switching them from the current kit.\n\nIn my opinion, warrior should not be tweaked too much and I would only suggest 1 of the above change to come through, for it is in a great spot right now, VERY powerful and useful, nerfs and buffs should come one at a time to strike the perfect balance. The main problem that people complain about comes from it being able to abuse render distance to quickly get on top of the opponent. This is mainly a desync issue, so if desync gets addressed, warrior would be more manageable."

(altho i guess that witch does have deto flow which is amazing ranged catch, but wiz has nothing of the same calibar for catching people that fast)\n\ni actually think the first protected tick of heal is a good idea (maybe even make small targetable heal protected in awk stance only - via hotkey, as we are meleeish casters), but additional buffs from it might be a bit of overkill loaded up on same utility spell. would be better to ask for some eva/dr buff on some of the other offensive spells in the kit maybe. \n\nalso while we are on the topic, they could downright remove rabam heal(defo overtuned spell) and make it something else and compensate casters somehow with extra survivability options other way."

Hashashin currently has a 9% selfbuff on an unprocted slow skill with 0 damage wich on proper fights its hard to use even if you use it by the time you actually engage into a fight its over or almost over.\nMy suggestion would be to increase his skills base accuracy from 0% to 5-10%, as most classes in the game have between 5-15% base acc some even more.So one of the options below would be enough1. Increase base accuracy  to 5-10%2. Remove  9% selfbuff but increase base accuracy to 8-15%3. Increase base accuracy to 5% and add SA or FG to 9% selfbuff4. Increase base accuracy to 5% but give higher accuracy to 1 or 2 skills  to allow hashes have some skills that pressures high evasion classesHP Regeneration on skills: Right now hash awaken only has hp regen in 1 skill wich is rly small aoe, i suggest adding hp on hit to Serpent coil's or ensnaring sands both skills require hashashins to stand in place for 3-4 secs or longer if slowed and since the class is already squishy this would help in pvp a bit but mostly in pve where doing those skills in high end pve like hexe/trolls often results in losing alot of hp."

        "content": "Family Name: Faustian_BargainRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening SageSuggestion: Awk Sage PvP adjustments, bug fixes, miscellanous Details: While the recent buffs to PvE have left Sage in a very good state, Sages PvP continues to be sub-par and in a very awkward spot meta-wise. This is in part due to recent changes that were marketed as improvements to Sage PvP, while in actuality reducing his protections, QoL and in the case of Impaling Flash, making a skill downright unusable.\nMy suggestions, in no particular order, are:\n\n#1 Bug Fixes:\nAfter the changes to Spear Bolt, Sages in-combat movement has felt quite good, however that is only as long as SP actually decides to work, which it often does not. Particularily frequent is a bug where an overcharged spear bolt is not protected and you get CC'd mid dash (Spear Bolt Protection Bug Example). One that happens less frequently but is equally as infuriating, is where the skill puts you high in the air for a falling animation due to miniscule unevenness on the ground (Spear Bolt Falling Animation).For the first one, I'd suspect the issue lies in the rapid swapping of SA-iframe-SA, which might or might not be fixed by expanding the time spent in protection by a tiny margin. For the second one, I'd like for spear bolt to function much in the same way Surge does, where it traces you along the ground, making dropping out of mid-air impossible.\nImpaling Flash also continues to be unusuable in large parts of PvP due to almost reliably putting you within terrain, notable are especially Fort and Siege walls which one easily bugs into when using Impaling Flash anywhere near them.\n\n#2 Stamina issues:\nSaying Sage is starved for stamina is an understatment. Even in comparison to other stamina heavy class like Sorceress, Sage struggles to recover any Stamina due to all movement skills consuming large amounts or locking stamina. This problem is exasperated by the mobility creep that set in with the other class reboots. Putting stamina recovery on Divine Executioner to have a tool with long CD for stamina recovery would be advisable. I also believe that Surge should only lock stamina, as is it is an unprotected, extremely short movement that is already difficult to work into combat situations which also eats into your precious stamina pool. This would also handily help alliviate some of Sages out-of-combat movement problems, where it can be increasingly difficult to keep up with any other class, while lacking targets for spear bolt and impaling.\n\n#3 PvP specific adjustments:\nFirst of all, the recent changes to removing forward guard off cooldown on Shock Relay, as well as reducing the range of Impaling Flash have crippled Sage more than anything. Having a protected way of cancelling into casts that are otherwise hard to access, like Lightning Prison, every so often was a very important tool in large scale PvP, where every frame spent unprotected is a risk. There was no particular reason given for this change. If for whatever reason this was deemed too strong, the cooldown of Shock Relay could be increased up to 10 seconds if necessary.\nImpaling Flash is off even worse, having personally been relegated to only be a panic button for 10% BSRs. The changes, which were supposedly meant as improvements, were completely off the mark: Having the option to return to your casting position would be a neat mechanic, but it only makes sense if the skill has enough range to warrant it as a form of ranged harrasment, in the same veins as forward Upsurge, Enlightening Bolt or Chain lightning. By reducing the range however, this mechanic goes completely unutilized, since Sage does not have the HP or DR to want to linger in the same spot for any extended amount of time. The reduced range also completely denies the previous use of the skill, which was to chase up fast moving classes like Musa, making it now a skill I genuinely have to question the purpose of. Simply reverting all changes made to Impaling Flash would be more than welcome.\n\nSages damage by my estimate does not need adjustments in larger fashion, due to being able to largely ignore accuracy in favour of stacking more AP/Human damage and having very reliable kill pressure on combos.\n\nRift Storm is in need of a ranged adjustment, since the recent PvE buff, a larger part of its damage is now in the last hit, which is quite difficult to land on a standing target due to the considerably small range of its AoE and long cast time. Downsmash removal would be acceptable.\n\n#4: Miscellaneous:\nWith the reboot, a lot of classes have successfully gotten skills that were previously exclusive Flows changed to being their own seperate skills. Sages QoL and ease of balancing would also majorly benefit from this treatment, specifically when talking about Aftershock and Interrogate.\n\nAftershock is, in all practicality, a second charge for spear bolt with the same exact usage. However, due to being treated as a flow, it leads to issues like the core skill only working on spear bolt, as well as cancels like Surge-Spear Bolt or Chain Lightning-Spear Bolt not working for aftershock in case Spear Bolt is on cooldown. If seperating the skill proves to be difficult, at least an adjustment to have the same behavior for cancels would be appreciated.\n\nInterrogate is already its own skill in all but technicality, having nothing in particular to do with Lightning Prison it is the Flow of. However, due to scaling with Lightning Prisons third hit damage and pvp % reduction, it has greatly suffered due to the balance changes focused on Lightning Prison. Most recently, while the PvP % reduction got correctly adjusted for Lightning Prisons PvE damage, it ended up accidentally nerfing Interrogates damage in PvP by a significant margin, due to it only scaling off the third hit of LP while the adjustment put more of its damage in the first hit.\nThe fix for this would be easy, to seperate Interrogate as its own skill with its own damage calculation, and putting it as a hotbar-only skill with the same current cancels.\n\nI hope this helps literally anyone, thanks for coming to my TED-talk."

        "content": "Family Name: KalYcosRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Succession HashashinSuggestion: Make Tornado cancelable, give us sustain and PvE-accuracy, change addons and protection/cc on Piercing TornadoDetails:\n1. When high geared its impossible to grind lower gyfin due to the tornadoes staying at the recently killed mob and will attack the one respawning. If it doesnt fit to the actual buff it mixes up the grind pretty decently. In other grindspots this is a problem too when you want to move to the next pack but the tornadoes stay at the previous one mixing up the aggro limit and the way you have to pull. Therefore, please give a skill to completely remove the tornadoes after a pack.\n\n2. Sustain. Please give us sustain. Eve with frenzy its pretty hard at higher spots and with Chosen Blade you usually loose more hp than you regen while using it due to the relatively long animation and mobs hitting while using the skill. My suggestion is to remove it from shadowsplitter and give it some more relavant skill in PvE.\n\n3. Accuracy. Please give us accuracy. In PvP its pretty hard against evasiontargets (btw striker and mystic being unkillable while onecomboing almost everyone with 269ap is kinda op but thats a different story) but with some lightstonecombo, accessories or an offhand you can somehow deal with it but in PvE you cant without loosing ap. Not that hash has good accuracy in PvP but its already very strong and kinda doesnt deserve much more. The solution for the PvP-PvE balance would be a passive that applies only in PvE like critrate or ccs already have.\n\n4. Having two T3 addons on Decent and Hourglass is very strong. Hourglass giving a total of 20ap for 10sek while being an iframe and it can be cancelled very nice as well as Decent spawning tornadoes and being one of the most damaging AoE skills is very nice but a bit too strong tbf. Maybe change one to a T2 addon since 40 extra ap (Hourglass giving 20 all ap and 20 monster ap) would already be strong enough on only one skill.\n\n5. The Protection on Piercing Tornado while being a multihit-cc and a decent movement skill with decent damage is very strong in PvP. I would suggest to adjust the cc to apply on only one hit (probably at the end) and maybe give it a frontal guard instead of superarmor."

        "content": "Family Name: СолуRegion: RUContent: atoraxion Suggestion: add the ability to go soloDetails:\nJudging by the databases, you are preparing the 3rd part of the atoraxion and it seems that it will be quite unusual, unlike the first two parts, but I would like you to finalize the first two parts.\nIt's not really popular, and it's not just the complexity, but rather the fact that every week you look for a party, and a party of players who play well and know the mechanics. Of course, there are those who have their own pack, KP and all that, but even among such groups, not all of them go and favor atoraxion.\n\nI propose the following changes.\nAdd the ability to close the atoraxion solo (alone).\nAt the moment, Atoraxion does not spend luck scrolls, it is difficult for many to find a party, and even if they find it, not everyone passes it quickly or even successfully.\n\nI suggest adding (and not replacing) just adding (alternative) the ability to close the player's dungeon alone (alternative solo passage instead of group, if the player does not have his own KP or does not want to look for a party), but in this case he will spend scrolls of luck.\n\nFor example: During the pharma hadum spots, special key fragments will fall with some probability, 10 fragments are needed to craft the key and depending on the type of atoraxion ...\nIf this is a seasonal or regular channel, then you will need to craft a special key with the help of 10 pieces of key fragments and one piece of a blue-rank luck scroll\nIf this is the Hadum (Elvia) channel, then you will need to craft a special key with the help of 10 pieces of key fragments and one piece of a yellow rank luck scroll\nAnd with this key, it will be possible to go directly through soul magic into the room with the boss, i.e. the player will not need to go through all the stages of collecting (farming) Lucretia's dagger, etc The player will be able to enter the dungeon alone and close it.\n\nOf course, the mechanics of the bosses themselves are set up so that you need to go through together, there are stages where two or more players participate, what to do with them?!\n\nIn Vaamakia, remove the mini-games and other parts of the mechanics. Let Lucratia immediately appear together with the rider together, and not separately. The player will initially have a limited amount of time to kill the boss, for example 10 minutes, if he cannot kill the boss in 10 minutes, he will have to start over.\nFrom time to time, spheres of different colors will appear at different points in the room with the boss.\nYellow, adds +2 minutes to the time\nRed, increases player damage by 30 seconds\nGreen, restores the player's HP to 100% and, as a buff, restores the player's HP by 300hp every 2 seconds for 30 seconds Blue, buffs the player to defend for 30 seconds.\nPurple, the boss freezes, and his defense decreases by 10 seconds\nAll spheres of 1 piece each appear at once, they do not move but stand still, each time each color appears in different places, you can take (activate) only one sphere, when one is activated, all the others disappear until the next appearance.\nAlso, when these spheres appear, the boss himself also flickers with one of these colors, and if the player takes a sphere of the color that the boss is flickering with, this buff gets the boss and not the player\nYellow, reduces the time by 30 seconds\nRed, increases boss damage by 30 seconds\nGreen, restores boss HP by 20%\nBlue, buffs the boss to defend for 30 seconds.\nPurple, the player gets a strong slowdown for 30 seconds\nthat is, the player will need to take the spheres of the color that is not currently on the boss and at the same time do not forget the time and calculate everything so as to kill the boss before the time runs out. And at the same time not to fall for his strong attacks.\n\nIn Sikarakia, also remove all the mini-games and mechanics, as well as add a timer for killing the boss for 15 minutes.\nThe player, as well as in the usual party passage, can change the level of the boss on the plate, where his damage increases and his defense decreases, and vice versa.\nIn addition, on 6 tiles on the floor (the location with the boss is divided into 6 parts, like pizza parts), fish appear on each plate at the beginning, which will move to the boss and disappear if they touch the boss, the player does not have to kill them, but for each killed + 1 minute is added to the time.\nAfter, during the battle, different numbers appear on the tiles on the floor, for example: 20-38-15-40-11-55, each plate has its own number\nthe player will need to look at two other standing plates, on which there will also be numbers, for example: 10 and 5, the player needs to add and the answer will be 15 and stand on the stove, on the floor with the number 15, if he does everything correctly, the player will receive increased protection for 30 seconds, if not, 2 minutes will be taken away from the remaining time.\nNext, a game with colors(which already exists), where the boss is alternately summoned in different colors, white, blue, yellow, red. If the player guesses which color was called more than others, the player gets a buff for an increased attack, otherwise, 1 minute of the remaining time will be taken away.\nThen the boss closes in the energy barrier, and does not receive damage (like a thunderstorm kutum). 6 squids will appear around, one in each plate on the floor, they are standing still. The player can kill all the squids and the energy barrier will fall and it will be possible to beat the boss further. Or kill squids in the sequence that will be indicated on two standing slabs, in this case, the player will receive a buff for damage and defense, but it will take 30 seconds from the remaining time.\nAnd at the end there will be two scorpions, one will have a high defense but a low attack, the second vice versa\nThe player will need to quickly kill a scorpion with low defense but high attack, from this scorpion the player will receive a damage buff, and will be able to quickly kill a second scorpion with high defense and low attack.\n\nI want to summarize right away, these methods of passage will not replace the current state of the passage of dungeons, but will simply add a second alternative method of passage for those who want to close solo and fight only with the last boss. Of course, in order to go solo, you need to go through the storyline at least once per account, which can only be done in a group of 5 people.\n\nThus, players will start spending their accumulated luck scrolls, and those who do not have them will start buying\nEvery week, you can pass twice each atoraxion, i.e. a maximum of 4 passes, this is either 4 ordinary blue-rank luck scrolls, or even 4 yellow-rank scrolls.\n\nMoreover, you can, for those who have a premium set, once a week, every Thursday, for each dungeon, give out one ready-made key to choose from, for a regular passage in a regular channel or a complex one on the hadum (elvia) channel, they will craft two more by spending good luck scrolls (if they want each danj close twice) Of course, in order to craft, as already mentioned, you also need fragments of the key, if you craft all 4 keys yourself, you will have to farm 40 fragments of the key every week, this is still + where you will need to spend scrolls of luck. And with the premium set, you will need to farm 20 shards and spend only 2 blue or yellow rank luck scrolls if the player plans to close 2 times each dungeon every week. Or maybe just get two ready-made keys every week through a premium set to choose from and close each dungeon once.\nAlso, from time to time, it will be possible to distribute these keys through achievements or calendars.\n\nThere will be more players who will pass the dungeons, because the boss battle is the most interesting, and the key will give you the opportunity to skip the farm of Lucretia's daggers, etc., players will be able to immediately fight with bosses and spend their luck scrolls. And most importantly, it will take not an hour of time, but 10-20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes at most, and they will receive quite generous awardsalso now there is a very severe shortage of Memory Fragment\nthis would allow players to get a good amount of these items"

The first system is \"peaceful\" it is given by default to all new guilds, all guilds start their journey with this system. All guilds and all guild members of the \"peaceful\" system receive a permanent buff +20% friendship with NPC (NPC)\n\n2. The second system is \"craft\" to switch to this system, the guild will have to complete 100 craft tasks.\nAfter switching, the guild (or rather the members of this guild) will receive special buffs\n+30% to craft experience\n+30 to mastery\n+5% to auto-fishing speed\n+20% to the chance of a crit when shooting from a wick gun\n+30% profit on the sale of imperial cooking\n+30% profit on the sale of imperial alchemy\n+10% to the processing speed of materials using manos processing stone\n+30% to the profit, from the distance to the goods when selling trade packs that are made by workers in homes\n+10% to the speed of growing seeds in vegetable gardens\n+ 5% to all ship stats\n+10% reduction in persuasion during barter\nThe Craft Guild can only participate in nodal sieges\nA craft guild cannot participate in castle sieges unless it fulfills a special condition\n\n3. The third system is \"Battle\" to switch to this system, the guild will have to complete 100 Battle missions(killing monsters)\nAfter switching, the guild (or rather the members of this guild) will receive special buffs\n+20% drop chance\n+70% to combat experience\n+30% to skill experience\n+5 to monster damage\n+50,000 to agris' maximum reserve of zeal\n+30,000 to the daily restoration of agris' zeal\nThe Battle Guild can only participate in nodal sieges\nA Battle guild cannot participate in castle sieges unless it fulfills a special condition\n\n4. The fourth system is \"bloody\" in order to switch to this system, the guild will have to complete unique tasks, without time and channel restrictions. Kill 30,000 players, and it doesn't matter where, in the PC, on sieges, in the arena of blood, in the arena of solare.\nAfter switching, the guild (or rather the members of this guild) will receive special buffs\n+30% to karma recovery\n+10 to arena signs, during victory or defeat in the blood arena\n+3 to damage on people\n+100 to the maximum HP and MP reserve\nThe Blood Guild can participate in node sieges\nThe Blood Guild can participate in castle sieges\n\n5. The fifth system of the \"ruler\" to switch to this system, the guild must initially be in the bloody system and will capture a certain castle. every month, one of the three castles will have a ruler effect\nif a guild with a bloody system captures this ruler's castle\nA guild under the ruler's effects can have all the effects of all systems, peaceful, craft, battle and bloody, as long as it holds the ruler's castle, or until the ruler's effect moves to another castle\n\nHow do craft and battle guilds participate in castle sieges?\nSpecial system, \"Additional Temporary System\"\ncrafting and battle guild system, can temporarily become a bloody guild system\none quest per week\nkill 5,000 players within a week\nfor this it is not necessary to kill in the world, it is possible in the arena of blood, in the arena of freedom, arsha, etc.\nthe quest will concern all guild members and can be completed in all channels at once\nIf these guilds with a temporary bloody guild system are able to capture the castle, they will get the ruler effect while holding the castle.\nIN OTHER WORDS. Divide all guilds into those occupations (specializations) that they are most engaged in\n\nand add special guild missions for the bloody guild system\nin the world, very often, several guilds fight just like that, not during a siege, on ordinary weekdays in the afternoon and evening\nthere is no motivation, the battle goes on, until one of the parties gets tired and leaves\nadd special guild quests or events\nfor example, guild A, takes the quest to kill 500 players\nthe quest randomly selects a guild of its level\nof course, the quest can only be for a guild that is already at war with that guild\nand at the same time, you need to kill 500 players before they themselves die 550 times\nthe quest will be credited if you kill 500 times the players of the guilds selected through the quest\nthe quest will fail if you yourself die 550 times from the players of the guild that was selected through the quest\nand no matter what the rewards will be\nthe very possibility of fighting against guilds where there is at least some kind of goal, even if it is in the form of a quest with terrible rewards, will create a strong motivation to playOf course, these are just ideas, you can make them yourself as you like.\nthe point is to motivate."

        "content": "Family Name: CosmicCube\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Witch (Awakening)\nAwakening witch is deficient in a few places:  Mobility, Defense, and overall DPS.  The following suggestions are not meant as a holistic change but rather independent options for how changes could be made to either patch the holes it has in abilities or buff its intrinsic qualities.\nMobility:\nSuggestion: Allow teleport to be used off cooldown in awakening spec.\nDetails: This would come at a high cost of stamina but allow us to not only move and engage with a ball better but just have more options in how we position ourselves after engaging. Edit: Forgot to mention that it would be unprotected off cooldown, just a way to move quickly in a short burst.  We don't need more sorc like classes in the game.\nSuggestion: Reduce cooldown of magic evasion to 1 second, remove use on cooldown\nDetails: This would allow more protected repositioning options to dodge damage and cc’s.\nSuggestion: Add 50% reduce stamina consumption for 5 minutes to Spellbound heart.\nDetails: If nothing else, let us run longer\nSuggestion: Using magical evasion from pre-awakened should use awakened magical evasion.\nDetails:  This helps our transitions and allows us to be a bit more mobile in pre-awakening as well.\nDefenses:\nSuggestion: Replace AP on passive with HP/DR/EVA (I’m torn on which would be better)\nDetails: We already have a flat 20 AP passive, we didn’t need another.  The fact caster can reach NW/Siege caps at a lower overall gear investment is detrimental to our performance in those modes as damage is balanced around uncapped content which assumes we have an extra 30ap over everyone.\nSuggestion: Increase uptime on magical shield or make it a passive in the awakening kit\nDetails: While it’s not an absolutely massive boost to survivability, it is noticeable and I think it’s fair given the lack of mobility that we should have ways of mitigating damage.\nSuggestion: Send x% of received damage to summoned pet (thinking 10% would be decent)\nDetails: I’m not a huge fan of the current pet buff implementation, it puts too much emphasis on benefits to DPS and utility and none elsewhere.  This leads to issues like the pet dying lowering our overall damage output and somewhat forces us to summon the pet anytime we die as the pet buff itself doesn’t stay through death.  I’d like to see the pet harnessed in a more utility/defensive capability where rather than adding damage to skills it adds to our survivability and adds special effects to skills (like slow to thunderstorm, bigger AOE to equilibrium break, etc).  Considering our damage isn’t amazing, I think the extra hits should just be added to the base skills to begin with.  Our pets are easily killable now, might as well harness that fact.\nSuggestion: Increase damage our forward guads can take\nDetails: I mean seriously, this likely needs to happen to a lot of classes but my forward guard skills don’t actually have forward guard 90% of the cast time and this is kind of a problem when your class is fairly heavy in immobile forward guard skills.  There’s already so many ways and classes that can just flat bypass forward guards, at least let them take some damage.\nDPS:\nSuggestion: Speed up casting time for awakening skills by about 5%\nDetails: Nothing fancy here, would just like the casting time for skills to be a bit lower as being locked in those animations is one of our biggest problems.\nSuggestion: Reduce cooldown of Barrage of Lightning\nDetails: The 20 second cooldown on this skill is a bit too much, I’d personally prefer 10 seconds but maybe 12-15 is more reasonable.\nSuggestion: Add block break to yoke of ordeal.\nDetails: Another simple one, we don’t have any way to break an SA block right now other than flat damage gear checking people.  I think yoke is a decent skill to add it to due to the inherent risks involved in using it.\nSuggestion: The pre-awakened kit needs an overhaul: Update the ranged skill casting speed to be more similar to current succession succession cast speeds and projectile speed.  Rebalance absolute skills to actually be an upgrade.\nDetails: The pre-awakened kit is basically a meme at this point.  The absolute skills do significantly less damage then the previous tiers, there’s no protection on them, and they take a long time to cast.  I don’t think there needs to be more protections but it would be good to be able to cast them quickly as risky pokes and quick catches.\nOther:\nSuggestion: Allow lightning blast to be used from pre-awakening\nDetails:  Just an alternative skill to get back to awakening from pre-awakening as I don’t like using detonative flow to do it since that puts it on cooldown and wastes one of the best fast catches we have.\nSuggestion: Overall defensive overhaul for the game\nDetails: I wouldn’t say the game itself has too much damage but more investment into defenses gives too little return on that investment for pvp (or more specifically large scale).  Even then its more there’s classes that require heavy investment into both to even reach the starting point of some classes that can invest in 1 or the other.  I’m not sure there’s a perfect way to tune this so that 1v1 or small scale fights feel as good as 100v100 fights so maybe the real answer is lower the number of people in those fights or revamp the NW/Siege system in general (desperately needs this anyway)"

        "content": "Family Name: Evaziel_ZiatriRegion: NAClass: Succession Dark KnightSuggestion: Add a taunt skill for PvE and give back the bounds for PvPDetails: About the taunt skill, that's something all classes should have, if not a skill at least a consumable that makes mobs grab your aggro, classes like Shai and Zerker have it and makes the grinding more convenient, in zones where the mob packs are around 10 it isn't really needed but areas where the mobs are scattered it's a waste of time attacking each small pack to grab the aggro.About the bounds, the addition of SA and frontal to some skills was nice, but losing the bound of both obsidian and lunacy was nonsense, to start with  even if lunacy has a high damage the cooldown is way too long for it, if it was a knockdown instead of a bound that would be a really broken skill, but a bound isn't a heavy CC, regarding to obsidian while the cooldown is shorter that was the only skill PvP wise that gave succ DK a chance to catch up with an opponent fleeing, specially classes with a lot of dashes like musa/mae/striker/mystic, if the problem is obsidian having a high dmg then why not just enable the bound of Shadow strike? or at the very least give Shadow bullet a better targeting or aoe to give us a ranged stiff, that skill is supposed to be ranged but in the end using it in point blank range because it will miss most of the time if you try to hit in the distance."

        "content": "Family Name: ACanadianDudeRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Succession & Awakening WitchSuggestion: A multitude of things. Read further below.Details:\n(If you've already read my comment to your post on Reddit by name of u/ACanadianNoob, the content of this post is the exact same.)\nFirst of all, thank you Vedir for taking the time to create this post, read everyone's feedback, parsing it into Korean, and sending it to the developers. I really appreciate the effort. :)\nFrom a Witch standpoint, awakening as a whole feels like it's still stuck in simpler times, like 2017. It's just not fast enough. It needs to be a bit faster for PvP purposes, and honestly it wouldn't be too crazy in PvE if you made it faster either. The side hops have too long a cooldown to be useful as well. I'd like to see them be able to be used to dodge grabs, perhaps by having a very brief iframe at the beginning of the dash, transitioning into SA afterward similar to awakened Sage.\nThere are a couple things that Wizard had that Witch still doesn't get. The AP buff on Hellfire has no equivalent on Witch. Wizard also gets 20 more base evasion. I see no reason for this and Witch should have the same stat boosts available to it as Wizard.\nForward Guards are very valuable for trading damage, but Witch has some very slow skills that make FG a questionable choice for them. She also just has too many FGs and not enough SAs compared to Wizard. Yoke of Ordeal is very slow, it either needs the Chilling Wave treatment and be sped up considerably, or it needs its FG switched to Super Armor (with damage reduction like other SA in the kit). Yoke of Ordeal's tooltip is incorrect as well, Yoke has the same number of hits as Chilling Wave (tested in BA), but the tooltip states it has less hits. Equilibrium Break also needs to have its first marking hit removed, or the marking hit needs to do damage.\nSuccession is a mixed bag. I think the slows should be removed from Prime: Lightning Storm: High Voltage as it is a protected damage trade ability. I also think that Prime: Residual Lightning: High Voltage should become a ranged skill like its Absolute counterpart. IF residual's unprotected version became ranged, I would say you can safely remove slows from the SA version as well. Or change the lightning slows to only affect movement speed and not attack speed. We kinda do need some debuffs to relieve constant pressure from melee classes, but it is a bit overturned at the moment and causing a lot of frustration for others.\nNow I don't want just nerfs to utility slows for Succ Witch/Wiz. The class needs two things. It needs some accuracy, and it needs some PvE damage. Damage in PvP is fine, but against some targets is very hard to apply. Part of this is not having any accuracy in the kit. I don't want to go back to the days when we applied -15% evasion debuffs at all times and made every evasion player take more damage from everyone. But a 9% accuracy rate self buff skill would go a long way. Also, I should not make less than when I play awakening when I play succession in PvE. Full stop, the kit requires much more effort. It needs significantly more PvE damage and perhaps even lower cooldowns on skills other than MMA.\nClass damage ratios are also atrociously in favor of other classes against Witch. This has been improved somewhat like recently against Hash, but I would like to see people actually fear running into awakening's AoE. That said, if you buff them by too much succession will need a damage adjustment in PvP on its skills to bring it back to where it is now. Awakening needs better trade potential, not succ. Succ isn't trying to be an immobile turret damage trade class when all the stat checks in the game are not in its favor.\nSomething that bothered me ever since the reboots is that none of the OG classes had their absolute mainhand kit adjusted to be similar mechanically to their succession kit, just with less damage, protected CCs, and passives which further boost the prime skills. You know that the mainhand skills on the OG classes are very clunky. Ranger doesn't need 5x charging mechanics for stuff like Tearing Arrow and Charging Wind in absolutes. And the flow from Bypassing Wind into Tearing Arrow doesn't properly skip charging on absolute. There's nothing in the tooltip to say it doesn't work for absolutes. Witch and Wizard's mainhand kit is atrociously outdated. Earthquake needs to use the same animations as its prime version for sure, Blizzard mechanics need to be adjusted as skill add-ons don't apply after the first couple hits as you transition into Ultimate: Blizzard. Some combos from succ should be there, like weaving Earth Arrow after Fireball Explosion, and being able to follow up from Residual Lightning to Lightning Storm just by holding RMB. I'm not asking for much here but the mainhand absolutes on these classes have been too clunky for years, and I was really hoping they should be simplified versions of Prime skills after the reboot similar to how it works for newer classes.\nAlso honorable mentions to Tamer. Their pet's damage has been bugged forever since reboot. He does no damage even if you take off all your armor. Also the CC on Heilang's flow skills became a coinflip as to whether they work on someone standing still let alone someone moving after Pearl Abyss removed many of the CC attempts from the skills. Heilang's AI apparently often breaks and stops attacking as well. All of the pet mechanics on this class were completely fucked BY the reboot and need to either be fully reverted or otherwise fixed.\nAnd to be honest most of the above buffs wouldn't be needed if Pearl Abyss hadn't buffed so many other classes beyond the level of reasonable."

I agree that before the nerf fighting a succ kuno was so hard because his unlimited mobility, but right now in this meta with all the protections and fast mobilities she can't do to much because she can't extend a fight, she can't chase anyone anymore and she can't stay protected like other classes and that leaves succ kuno far behind other assasins and unfun to play, I would say that even before the reboot succ kuno was way more fun to play than her current state.\n\nI think the concept for the class before the nerf was about high and sustained mobility without any SA linger or reliable frontal to make the gameplay \"slower\" and the nerf was to much that killed the concept of the class.\n\n My suggestions are as follows:-Revert one of the nerfs, could be flash slash or tendon cutter and make her block not consume stamina.\nor-Add a new skill with a SA linger and a decent cd, it does NOT need to be a great mobility or a cc potential skill. (Could be a rework from Crecent Slash, it could be similar to the succ ninjas crecent slash skill)"

Sage succ problem is more about a few other class who are just too strong, the spec itself is fine."

This class has good mobility with decent protection and the ability to keep good pressure. However, there are sometimes where you are doing the best the class can provide and you are punished by some odd behaviours of some skills.\n\nCorrections/Improvements:\n[from Shattering Darkness to Flow:Bombardment] When using these 2 abilities one after another, there seems to be a gap in the Frontal Guard between them, because you can get CC'd in the middle of the transition between these skills. This is much more evident when slows are applied to your character. Please, make the linkage of Frontal Guard better when using these abilities together.\n\n[Cluster of Despair] Please, make it possible to move the ability direction by moving your camera. People can do it by using mouse-movement but it is cluncky. Furthermore, there are times that I have positioned my camera in one direction and the skill is used in the previous direction. This change would solve both problems.\n\n[Touch of Expoitation] The start animation of this ability is rather slow, making it very difficult to use in PvP. Please, make the start animation a little faster (about 10%).\n\n[Unvieled Dagger] We use this ability mainly to get the 10% Attack Speed buff, but this buff is rather short in time. Please, make the buff duration 10 seconds. This would go very well with the Q Block buff (Dark Shadow).\n\nMatchups:\nI understand that classes need some tweaks on damage between them, not only to adapt to each class playstyle, but to give somewhat a sensation of identity to each one. However, this class has some matchups that are too unfavorable, to the point that the player loses interest in trying to fight them.\n\nMystic [77.93%] / Striker [77.93%] / Nova [81.17%] The damage ratios against these classes are too low.\nDark Knight [105.53%] They do too much damage to themselves, making the fights not very enjoyable."

        "content": "Family Name: IlClaudialIRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: Make \"Cartian's Protection\" skill able to be assigned to a quick-slot again.Details: The \"Cartian's Protection\" skill was a very important skill in the sorceress' kit. Circa 2020, the sorceress was able to assign this skill to a quick-slot. This was removed. This skill allowed the sorceress to quickly react to the direction of an incoming attack by casting our Forward Guard in whichever direction the camera was facing AND it was spammable meaning that once the FG was casted, if a second attack came towards our unprotected back, then we could immediately cast the fg again (spam it) in the second direction to block the second attack. This is extremely skillful as opposed to just casting an iframe or an SA, and it was open to being counter-played by repositioning and casting more and more attacks thus making a real fight happen. Around 2021, This skill was changed so that it now can no longer be assigned to a key and thus can only be used by RMB or DownArrow+C. The fact that it now cannot be quick+slotted made it lose three important properties, which I argue should be reinstated. One property was that when this skill could be quick-slotted, it would cast instantly (it was spammable) and switch the sorceress from mainhand to awakening mode, but most importantly would cast the forward-guard block in the direction of the camera and so a skilled sorceress could quickly turn the camera to block fast incoming attacks from the enemy. This is impossible to do now as once the \"Cartian's protection\" skill is casted, it cant be recasted again unless the sorceress slowly moves backwards. and thus if an enemy is quick they can just cast one skill on the sorceress's block to lock her in the block, then move behind her and CC her. Previously the sorceress could just spam this skill from quick-slot and that would make it impossible for us to get locked in the block stance, so if an enemy quickly moved behind us after the first attack on our block, we could just rotate our camera and keep spamming the skill to block the second attack. Instead the sorceress is now out of options after the first attack and will likely receive the full blow of the second attack. In my opinion this is unfair since there is nothing left for the sorceress to use to counter this scenario. Therefore my suggestion is to return the \"Cartian's Protection\" skill to the way it functioned before, as I've described here. Thank you."

        "content": "Family Name: IlClaudialIRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: Improve pursuit/chase mobility of Awakening SorceressDetails: Awakening sorceress is extremely slow at displacing herself across long distances beyond 20 meters. Usually if we are in a fight, all an enemy needs to do is run away and the Sorceress will be unable to give them chase due to how slow it is for traveling long distances as opposed to every other class. More so, the sorceress will lose a lot of her stamina pool, which she will need to have if she were to catch up with the enemy in the case it decided to stop running away. Moreover, if the sorceress wishes to chase at her top speed (which is still very slow and insufficient to catch up to any other class that decides to run away), she then usually has to sacrifice being protected under SA or FG since some of them may be on cooldown and thus she can just run instead of using mobility skills. this means that if the running enemy uses a ranged CC they will likely hit the sorc that is chasing them and kill her. This is rewarding cowardly play and the sorceress should at least be given the chance to be able to catchup with the enemy to finish the fight. Thus my suggestion is to improve the sorceress's pursuit/chase mobility. There are various ways i can think of, but some may have collateral effects in combat due to how the class works. one way is to halve the amount of stamina consumed by most of her mobility skills; another is to make it so that the sorceress' stamina is ALWAYS replenishing (never pausing) no matter what skill she uses, as even climbing a fence/wall/rock will halt stamina regeneration...; another is to halve the cooldown of her most important mobility skills so she can spam them more quickly; another is introducing a new mobility skill but this of course is more work for the developer. These are all quick brainstorming ideas, i could come up with more detailed and sensible ideas if requested. Thank you."

To recover a total HP pool of 6000 Health points starting from 10% of that, it can take the Sorceress up to an entire minute to fully heal herself; this while also being constantly healed by her fairy every 2 seconds with the infinite potion. I myself often run out and deplete my MP bar before I can fully heal myself to 100%. And all of this is while being completely unprotected and unable to help in pvp in any way. Meanwhile other classes like Witch, Wizard, Berserker, ninja, shai, Valkyrie, etc., can all heal themselves within a few seconds of using their healing skill, and they are next to immediately ready to jump again into the fight. It seems very unfair for sorceress to be a melee class above all and have a worse heal than more mobile and/or ranged classes and/or tankier classes such as those mentioned above."

This is extremely important in PVP games, which is why to me isn't that all surprising that BDO lacks this feature; A feature that can be toggled on/off from the audio settings that chimes a small sound whenever a skill is being attempt to be used but that is still on cooldown. This is such an important feature in highly competitive fast-paced videogames because while you are in the middle of the battlefield you just don't have the precious milliseconds needed to roll your eyes over to the cooldown meter for each skill. Especially for sorceress that already has to react at such high velocity and execute precise key-strokes since unlike other classes a mistaken or mistimed key-press will nearly always equate to her death. Not to mention that sorceress also needs to do this while already keeping track of her HP, her stamina and her buffs and debuffs along with her skill cooldowns. Adding a sound cue for attempting to use a skill that is still on cooldown can help not only sorceress but all fast-paced classes in combat."

        "content": "Family Name: Robicheaux.Region (NA/EU): NA.Class (Awakening/Succession): Awakening Corsair.Suggestion: Mostly PvE buffs & some PvP buffs.Details: As it stands, Corsair is a pretty dichotic experience - it simulates a cinematic viewpoint through gameplay but lacks in anything beyond visuals. It does lackluster damage, pulls lackluster trash, and feels ridiculously slows. Otters do not perform as well as say Striker Awakening's summons and given that Corsair was designed to depend on summon damage, it creates a very confusing gameplay loop. This is all without factoring in how underwhelming and unreliable the melee 'stance' is. Our sword skills lack range and damage to justify why they are unprotected and slow. What's more is that they are the least defining moment of the entire kit - we are better known for our summons and ranged fighting style rather than performing as a hybrid class. There is also a great deal of bugs with the kit (Labao on Deck! & No Mercy, Scallywags!) not performing the way they should and of course, our much-needed reliance on our Mermaid skills for additional protections to circumvent how awfully slow our skill animations are.Overall, the class lacks an identity. It performs weirdly in all content because of how clunky and flimsy it feels, especially when you compare data with other classes.Awakening Corsair needs their attack speed/skill animations to be buffed across the board by 10%.Range skills need a change on their CD, damage, and/or protection.Otters need to do more damage, either by implementing them into Corsair's skills like Nova Succession or making them attack faster and slightly increasing their damage on attacks.The mist mechanic is decent and cohesive to the theme of the class, especially when considering how our E Buff elevates it.Our E Buff (Family Honor) doesn't stack its AP bonus with our AP Buff (Pirate's Life For Me), rendering it useless beyond the much needed attack speed buff it provides.Lastly, our stamina costs are atrocious. We exchange the water-y, fluid mobility of Corsair Succession with hybrid range/melee pressure. . but literally can never move because everything drains us.Family Honor: Allow the AP bonus to stack with Pirate's Life For Me.Mareca Swing: This skill should cost 100 stamina. As our core movement, the speed of this cannot be controlled and we can very easily get caught being out of stamina just by spamming this skill.Absolute: Overflow: Increase the -15 DP debuff to -20. Increase the animation speed. No other buffs are needed. Give it Awakening functionality (you will remain in Awakening despite using this skill) by pressing W+Q.Close Quarters: Suppress I~IV: Increase the AoE on the front and the sides. Increase the critical hit rate to 75%. Change BON: Close Quarters: Suppress from a Super Armor to a Frontal Guard.Close Quarters: High Spirits: Remove every part of this skill except its last hit (the kicking animation). Share its damage stats with Close Quarters: Suppress I~IV, increase the range, and add a super armor. Allow it to cancel into other Close Quarters skills, Absolute: Overflow, and Pirate's Life For Me. Remove the critical hitrate buff and replace it with an attack speed buff of 10%. Add 10% critical hitrate to the skill. This will greatly increase the fluidity of its skills and make it beneficial to work by cycling through melee form. Close Quarters: Charge: This skill requires a buff on its AoE. The speed of the animation should also be increased and cancellable into the other Close Quarters skills so it can have more functionality for the melee 'stance'.Wave-breaker Patraca: Allow this skill to retain its canceling properties with the Close Quarters skills. Allow it to cancel backwards for Crow's Mark, Wind-piercer Patraca, and Cap'n's Orders: Open Fire! I~III. Give it off CD Super Armor and remove the Stiffness debuff. When cancelling into Cap'n's Orders: Open Fire! it will stop the Cap'n's Orders: Cease Fire! from performing.Pirate's Life For Me: Increase the range on this skill and give it a Super Armor. Increase the CD to five seconds.Spare No Quarter!: Increase the damage of the skill and the critical hitrate by 10%. Increase the speed. Allow it to ignore character collision. Reduce the stamina cost from 250 to 200.Sea Mist: Keep the same.Crow's Mark I~III: Increase the hits by x4. Increase the critical hitrate by 50%. Remove the Frontal Guard.Wind-piercer Patraca: Increase the hits by x3. Remove the Frontal Guard. Increase the critical hitrate by 25%. Keep the movement speed debuff.Sun-shielder Patraca: Increase the hits by x3. Increase the critical hitrate by 35%. Keep the Super Armor. Add an additional sliding animation for when you use Riding the Waves before or after the skill. Remove the Movement Speed debuff.Flow: Earth-render Patraca: Increase the hits by x3 and remove the Super Armor. Increase the speed of this skill's animation. Increase the critical hitrate by 25%. Ocean's Allure: Speed up the animation of this skill IMMENSELY and add a lingering Frontal Guard/Super Armor to it. Give this skill 100% critical hitrate.Cap'n's Orders: Open Fire! I~III: Increase the speed of the anchor. Add 50% critical hitrate.Cap'n's Orders: Cease Fire!:  Add 50% critical hitrate.Tide-splitter Patraca: Keep the same.Light 'Em Up!: Keep the same.No Mercy, Scallywags!: The only debuffs that this skill really warrants taking is the Evasion and Accuracy debuffs. Summons need their damage reworked. They do nothing because their damage is coded really low and they attack really slow! And sometimes their targetting is off. Why?Labao on Deck!: This skill has more use in PvP but Labao could very easily be better at applying the buff. He takes forever and more often than not, I just forget to use the skill because of that.Absolute: Mareca: Sea Stroll: Grant this skill grapple immunity. Absolute: Mareca: Jet Stream: Grant this skill grapple immunity. Allow Corsair to regenerate stamina while using this skill.Absolute: Mareca: Spiral Soak: Allow Corsair to regenerate stamina while using this skill. Grant this skill grapple immunity.Absolute: Mareca: Whale Song: Allow Corsair to regenerate stamina while using this skill. Grant this skill grapple immunity.Flow: Wave Skedaddle: Fix the bugs on this skill's invincibility frames please!Awakening Corsair cannot fulfill much of the content in the game when she is pre-dispositioned to only offer aggressive utility balanced around PvP. These changes would give her new functionality, placing an emphasis on remaining protected in melee stance and cycling through ranged skills for burst damage. While most of the proposed changes benefit PvE, there are also other things that the Corsair Community has been asking to be changed since release (like the Absolute Mareca skills' bugs, Wave Skedaddle's bugs, etc)."

        "content": "Family Name: IlClaudialIRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: Improve sorceress' vertical combat and motion; widen her vertical damage for all of her skills.Details: Two parts to this:I) Vertical Area of Effect of Sorceress' skills: The sorceress suffers from a terrible amount of inefficacy against enemies that can as much as climb a 1.5 meter wall. For example, Cartian's nightmare skill will fail to hit enemies that are just 1 meter above the surface where the sorceress is standing on when the casting animation of the skill clearly should be hitting the enemy. Meanwhile other enemies such as Wizard, Witch, Ranger, Berserker, can all hit the sorceress from above and from below elevated structures like boxes or short fences and classes like sorceress and musas/maehwa have no way to answer such cowardly tactics. BDO should not reward cowardly tactics. For the sorceress, climbing up there too, is not an option since these ranged classes can easily CC her while in the climbing animation, which also lasts far too long. Thus a simple solution to this might be to make climbing an iframe, but then that could be abused by climbing the nearest object to avoid damage. Thus a better solution is to give the sorceress and the other classes with vertical damage/mobility problems a wider vertical range for their attacks, which is to say to almost entirely ignore the Z axis for damage and just project the player positions onto an horizontal X-Y plane without the vertical Z axis considered when casting skills. Perhaps a more sensible solution would be to widen but only up to some reasonable limit the effect of skills on the Z axis to something like 20 meters or so. that way a witch standing on top of a 1-floor house will still get hit by a sorceress casting \"Grim-Reaper's Judgement\" skill and knock them down, but if the witch is standing over a 3-floor house then that would be out of range of the skill's vertical area of effect.\nA very clear example of theis problem can be found in the Castle Ruins flavor of the Red Battlefield arena. In there it is very popular for ranged classes to set up camp above walls in there, and classes like sorc can usually do nothing to fight back. It's just a shooting-range for ranged classes, and melee classes are the targets. Another exaple exists in another Red Battlefield map, Valencia City, inside the third capture-zone, if a sorceress casts most of her skills like Cartian's Nightmare or grim reaper's judgement at its highest point of this zone and an enemy is standing just 1 meter away in the direction of the center of this zone, most of the sorceress skills will entirely miss them even though the enemy is right in front of her and just about 0.5 meters lower. This is very unfair since she in turn can usually be hit by other classes not suffering from such severe vertical limitations.\nII) Mobility is also an extremely severe issue for sorceress in uneven terrain unlike some of the other ranged classes like witch/wizard. For example once again in the Valencia City Battlefield map, near zone #3 there is a building nearby that is very popular with ranged classes to sit on in a very unfair way I might add. It's quite an ordeal for a very slow melee class such as a sorceress to get up there in the first place, but the main problem I want to bring attention to is that after going through a lot for the sorceress to get up that building there are very small horizontal beams on the surface of the ceiling of this building but they are enough to trip the sorceress iframe (\"night Crow\") and limit her movement across the entire ceiling AND this doesnt affect other classes movements! Wizards, witches and Berserkers can freely move up here as if there were no horizontal beams at all. Please also make it so that it's a more even fight and so that the sorceress can also move freely over these short horizontal beams."

Comparable dash/skate skills from comparable Archer class do not have such insane hit stagger on them as the Ranger ones do, in fact, during multi hit skills, Ranger's Call from Sky (Superarmor), NOT ONLY does it receive air attacks, it can also get stopped mid air, floating, and get falling animation on the spot, effectively getting cced. To compact this issue, the other escape hops are slow and their travel is painfully short, on top of being staggerable to the point of never finishing the animation.\n   Therefore i'd suggest increasing the travelling distance of all hops (like you did for Prime EES) by at least 20%, removing or limiting the insane hit stagger, and increasing the animation speed by an equal 20%+ (and 50% for Call from Sky).\n\n3. HP Sustain\n   All classes have some skill that returns HP, even comparable classes like Archer, who have at least 2. So how is it logical that Ranger, being one of the squishiest classes, has literally none and has to chug potions? If you survive a situation with 5% hp, it can take almost a full minute of potion chugging just to reach the max again.\n   I'd suggest some form of HP return on skills like PUBG or Charging Wind (comparable with Archer's Luthragon Call).\n\n4. Rabam skill modernisation\n   The Rabam skills are extremely outdated, both on protections and damage, Roaring arrow was even created with SA, a correct decision for a skill so slow and cumbersome, but now left unprotected, for a several second charge up, static skill.\n   I'd suggest the return of SA back to Roaring/Fury Arrow, and some damage boosting relevant to how slow hitting it is (Roaring), and a 30+ boost to Fury, just to make it relevant again.\n\n5. Class modifiers\n   There's some unneeded weirdness in those that makes very little sense, to the detriment of Ranger, making one of the, if not THE squishiest class, by a wide margin.\nRanger damage done\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KCL5VHe\n\nSeems pretty even across the board, questions about the 90.91% to the shield classes and the 86.04% on Nova.\n\nRanger damage received\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/sfU71xk\n\nPractically everything bloated when receiving damage. Range \"was\" a protection before 2019, nowadays most classes can dash/teleport at you in 1 or 2 move skills, some can even teleport on your back from Ranger's almost max range (Hash: Arid Assault, Ninja: Blockjump). These modifiers make no sense for 2022.\n   I'd suggest an equalisation across the board to 100% (or below hopefully) but not for Wizard/Witch (they should remain as is) and especially vs teleporting classes that can oneshot you (Hash, Ninja, Kuno), leaving no room at all for counterplay.\n\nThank you for your consideration and thank you for your efforts on BDO, let's make a good game great."

        "content": "Family Name: IlClaudialIRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: (PART I) The most important suggestion I can ever contribute to BDO Class balancing: Remove the grab skill.Details:I have a lot of experience in pvp, not just BDO but in other games. In my previous MMO I had the highest kill-count. In NA I have the highest pvp kill-count from the sum of all pvp modes bdo has to offer, and I am pretty sure this is also true for every region of BDO worldwide. Needless to say I have a lot of experience in fighting enemies of all gear, classes, and tactics. My most important suggestion I can ever give to BDO with the goal of making PVP more balanced regardless of the class one plays, is getting rid once and for all of the Grab skill.\n\nThere are far too many reasons why the grab destroys any fairness in pvp, it's hard to find where to start; and even harder to understand how such an incredibly powerful skill has existed for so long in BDO.\n\nLet's begin with some very crude facts about the essence of BDO PVP. The goal of PVP is plain and simple, kill before you get killed. Each class is given many tools to reach this goal. Using high damage tools/skills are a good way to reach that goal, but there are also a set of defensive skills. The enemy can dodge your attacks just like you can theirs. They will obviously not just stand openly still and just take your damage face on, they have frontal guard (FG) and iframes to counter attack skills. So you brought a rock and they answered with paper, you now need to bring the scissors and that's where crowd-control (CC) skills come along. CC skills can disable your enemy from further using any defensive or offensive skill for a limited amount of time so that you can deal the necessary damage to reach the ultimate goal in PVP. But your enemy can still answer to your scissors by bringing the rock, and thats the Super Armor (SA) skills. However, there is of course a big problem in all of this. A majority of classes see this harmonious interaction of rock-paper-scissors and they bring a steamroller, in other words, the grab skills.\n\nThe grab skills are in fact in an entire league of their own, above all other skills.\nIt doesn't matter if you use FG properly, Grab defeats FG.It doesn't matter if you use SA, Grab defeats SA.It doesn't matter if you use iframe, you have to time your iframe precisely and predict when the grab will be casted. Most grab skills are instantaneous (have no casting animation or have casting animations so short that it is humanly impossible to react to) so effectively dodging a grab skill ends up not being about skill but about luck. In addition to this, grab skills were silently given priority by the developer over iframe some months ago.\n\nThus we have a balanced game of rock-paper-scissors all overridden by a Joker Card, the grab skill.\n\nEffectively, grab skills are by far stronger than any Ultimate/100% BSR skill. Since no other skill can grant the beholder what is essentially a roll of the dice to see if they get an instantaneous win or not AND in such a short cooldown time to add insult to injury. The only condition for grab to work is to be within range of the grab skill and once this is true there is nothing the person that is about to be grabbed can do, because grab goes through every defense system in this game. The fight thus becomes a gamble in favor of the grab caster, a dice-roll to decide whether the grab user gets a free win every few seconds or has to keep on obeying the laws of combat until his grab cooldown is replenished and they can ignore all of these rules again.\n\nWhen we think of what this is equivalent to, it is no different than giving a player a skill that does 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 points of damage to an enemy's Health. in the end the result is the same, the receiver of this skill ends up dead and there was nothing they could have done to avoid it except perhaps a purely luckily timed iframe. Their destiny was sealed once that quintillion-point damage hit, or the grab landed; the result is no different in the end since in the current state of the game a CC that lands almost always results in assured death, and the path that lead to that conclusion while it is different it is also irrelevant to the outcome. In the end, the grab goes through SA and FG just as a quintillion damage skill was cast on a player using SA or FG. Why does something so unreasonable exist in BDO? Something that has the shortest of casting animations, some are even protected, some are even ranged, some don't even need to be accurately aimed! They even have very short cooldown timers when compared to any 100%-BSR/q/e/z/ultimate buff skills; and yet grab skills outperform and are far more influential in deciding the outcome of battle than any of those so-called strongest skills/buffs; and there's more: grabs can be used in conjunction with those other advanced skills/buffs! It's madness.\n\nAll of this also leads to the following realization: Grabs are extremely low risk and generously high reward skills. GRAB SKILLS HAVE NO COUNTER AND THEY COUNTER EVERYTHING.\nNO COUNTER: If a grab isn't protected by SA it has a casting animation so short that at 60 FPS their unprotected casting of the grab is something from 5-10 frames, hitting it would be pure luck and it's unreasonable to even call this unprotected. Then of course there's the SA grabs from Strikers which can grab while being in SA and then subsequently cast an AOE CC around them (usually to CC players coming to aid the grabbed player) while the striker is still holding their grab and is still protected by SA. In effect, grab skills may only have a downside in that others might come help attack the player that is doing the grabbing, but this isn't an argument since we are talking about balance here and that implies to consider scenarios where the number of friends and foes are evenly matched including gear; that's why we can't consider those uneven situations here because we are focusing on situations that should be balanced and yet they aren't due to grab skills, unlike uneven situations which aren't balanced to begin with.\nCOUNTERS EVERYTHING: We already covered this, all mechanisms of defense (such FG, SA, and sometimes iframe) that exist in BDO to defend against CC skills are all rendered useless and break down against grab skills. This is not balance.\n\nunfortunately I'm tired of typing but I have not yet covered every reason why grab skills shouldn't exist in BDO.\n\n(To be continued in Part II under the same title in this same thread)"

        "content": "Family Name: IlClaudialIRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: (PART II) The most important suggestion I can ever contribute to BDO Class balancing: Remove the grab skill.Details:(Continued from PART I): Yet another reason why grabs break the delicate PVP balance. You don't need to know your enemy nor their class' unprotected skills in order to CC them if you have a grab skill available. Your objective as a grab-class is cookie-cutter, your objective is the same regardless of who or what class is in front of you, whether they are veteran or new, meta class or dead class, more geared than you or not; your objective is only one: get near to them, preferably approach them using high speed and protected movement or let them approach you, and cast your grab. In the rare case it gets predicted or resisted and you are out of grabs, you will need to play by the rules now until your grab skill is off cooldown and you get another gamble. Some shield classes abuse this by simply sitting in their simultaneous FG+SA stance and classes without a grab usually have a hard time with these, especially melee classes who need to get near them, and thus get into grabbing range of a class they have no means to CC.\n\nI have heard the pseudo-argument saying that this modality of a class with grab skill against a class without a grab skill is somehow fair because the class without a grab has to patiently wait for the right time to strike while all the time trying to trade damage and getting in range of the grab just to try to fish for that CC... Well how convenient it is to make such a remark from such a high horse! Why should the Grab class have that constant Joker card under their sleeve while the other class has to play under the unfair condition that she may get grabbed at any time while trying to do her work without a grab? This is no argument, either both classes have a grab skill, or preferably none have it. Why should one class always be the hunter, the aggressor, and the other has to always be the unfavored underdog, the prey? This is not balance. No one can tell me grab is fair until they have played as their main character a class with no grab skills from the past two years to present day, because then they would understand the underlying lack of balance that the grab skill brings to BDO.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:Therefore my proposed solution is the following:Eradicate grab skills from the face of BDO. Make every single grab skill in BDO follow the rules of combat of BDO1) You cannot grab a player whose Forward Guard skill is facing you.2) You can grab a player whose Forward Guard is NOT facing you.3) You cannot grab any player during their SA no matter what.4) Grab skills cannot CC an iframed player and should not have priority over it.\n\nThis is in my view, with all my PVP experience, the best solution by far to deal with this unreasonable thing known as grab skills. However, I also see an alternative approach to restoring the power dynamic around the grab skills, and that is to give every single class in BDO a grab skill. While I despise this path, I think it would help put into perspective how idiotic it is to have such a powerful skill such as the grab skill, when everyone has it. It's not really the best solution in my view as much as it would be just setting the entire house on fire, but I also realize that the developer might be very nervous and hesitant to do the right thing and take away their child's favorite toy, a skill that so many players rely upon so much that they couldn't imagine having to fight by proper and fair rules of rock-paper-scissors, removing once and for all a skill so powerful that it should have never existed.\n\nSome have made the argument to me that it would be unreasonable to give a highly slippery class like mine (sorceress) a grab. To those people I always point them to ninja, kunoichi, and most of all, lahn (Oh god the lahns! >.> ). I basically refer to these classes as \"sorceresses with a grab skill(s).\" While it is true that the sorceress differs in capabilities from ninjas and kunoichis, it's not by that much, and the fight is usually quite even between sorceress, kunoichi, and ninja if we ignore the grab skill; and I'd also argue that Lahn's can even outperform sorceresses at sorceressing! and they get a grab skill too! In fact, I would go as far as to argue that the developer arbitrarily decides who gets a grab skill(s) and which classes don't for no reason at all other than whim. The aforementioned classes along with the sorceress are all very fast-paced classes, I'd argue they have better mobility at traveling long distances than sorceress, they are all heavy-iframe user classes, lahn probably outperforms all of them at the latter. But for some reason sorceress is the only one among these that wasn't granted a grab and try as I may I can't see why that would be the case, it seems entirely arbitrary and at the expense of sorceress players. I have thought many times that, had sorc been released today instead of back in 2013 (was it?), then the sorceress would have been released with a grab skill too for no other reason than the developer seemingly being more charitable in giving out grabs to all new classes since the release of shai/archer I forgot which came out last but thats quite a few years ago. The number of classes with a grab skills outnumber the few that don't have a grab skill. And there doesn't seem to be any reason at all as to why the few that don't have it don't. A similar argument can be constructed for musa/maehwa: Why dont these two have a grab skill? Some would say it's because they are very fast classes (analogous to saying that sorceress is iframe-heavy so shouldn't have a grab skill) and thus they would argue that musa/maehwa too shouldn't be granted grab skills due to these reasons... But then we can point out that there are classes as fast or far faster than musa/maehwa that do have grab skills: Berserkers, Warriors, etc... The only reasonable conclusion we can draw here is that there is no valid reason why any class should not have a grab skill, especially when it is so decisive in battle.\n\nADDENDUM:I have also heard the argument that wrongly says that shield classes would be too strong if there weren't grab skills to go through their simultaneous SA+FG skill. Myself, having played Sorceress as my main class ever since my first day in BDO in late 2016 when Sorceress was considered the worst class in PVP, I can assert that shield classes like Warrior, Nova, Guardian and Valkyrie, would not become invisible if grab skills were entirely removed, because lets not forget that these shield classes for some reason not only have some of the best defense (simultaneous FG and SA) but also the best offensive skill by far in BDO: The grab skill. By eradicating the grab skill from BDO they are losing half of what makes them so dangerous to approach in their shields, and thats a good thing for balance. I don't mean to attack nor target any class in particular with this but I also want to bring up solid examples of why getting rid of grab skills makes sense; and that's the only reason why I mentioned those classes here.\n\nAs a final note regarding yet more alternative ways to rebalance the grab skills, I will leave here a link to a youtube video by the player known as ShakyBay. The video is from mid 2021 so some of the issues he mentions have been addressed already by the developer but others (including his views on grab skill mechanics in BDO) still remain true to this day. He includes a very good explanation of why grab skills are too strong but most importantly he provides a contrast of how grab skills work in other games. For example he mentions some fighting game where the most powerful kind of grab skill has a very long casting animation skill which gives time for an opponent to react to it and so it's an example of how BDO could rework grab skills to have a full 1 or 1.5 seconds of casting animation before the grab is deployed and thus giving an opponent the option to react to it if not counter it with a new combo-counter mechanic to actually punish the grab (which doesn't exist in BDO yet). Just avoiding it would be fine too, and so continue the dance that is BDO PVP rather than ending it abruptly because the grab user won the dice roll. That's so much better than what grab skills are now in BDO: Having no counter and countering everything, and casting almost instantaneously without any chance to avoid them other than sheer luck.\nHere is the video: https://youtu.be/zw7-hqwXKN4?t=1027\n\n\nI tried including every possible counter-argument along with the ones I've been presented with and this has been my response to all of them as to why there is no excuse why a technique so powerful such as the grab skill should continue to exist in BDO.\n\nIf you read all that then I'm very impressed! Treat yourself with a cookie or something nice!"

The rage version of the skill is the same as it was before reworks, before the Eradication changes. So since Eradication got reworked and now looks totally different I dont really know why the rage version of the skill was left untouched. Regardless, the current 10% rage version of the skill is really useless since it is very slow. My suggestion is to make the rage version of the sill look like the same as the current Eradication. But the rage animation should be really really fast, since the current base Eredication skill is good because it is fast. So a slow animation rage version from it would make it useless again.\n\n50%:\nThis would be a really usefull rage skill, if it would have faster animation.

Currently the skill has a Stun single cc effect. But the skill animation is that slow that it is not possible to follow up on the stun with a 2nd cc, since the character is in animation for that long that the enemy gets out of the stun. I would suggest to speed up the whole skill animation. If this cant be done, then at least give more damage to the skill."

Useless for PvP and PvE.\n\nEarth Splitter 3rd new reboot skill without protection but at least it has bound and much more dmg than Dragon Strike and Raging Wind together.

        "content": "Family Name: Mystici\nRegion (NA/EU): NA\nClass (Awakening/Succession): Wizard Awakening\nSuggestion: Class needs quite a bit or rework to movement and survivability\nDetails: \nThe original concept of the awakening wizard just doesn't work in this game any longer. Most of the new classes now come with exponentially more movement in both speed/distance traveled and with lower cooldowns. The Awakened Wizard used to be able to do relatively high damage compared to other classes and now not necessarily because our skills do less damage but due to the fact that our slow cast times and mobility prevent us from actually hitting anything. When we do engage in close combat and start to deal some damage we have the choice teleport in and deal damage then die, or try to casually stroll into a fight without using your teleport deal damage and teleport out and hope that someone doesn't track you down because most classes can move faster than your teleport.\n\nTeleport needs to be fixed, lower the cooldown drastically to 2-3 seconds (but increase stamina cost slightly or add some mana consumption) as once we have used teleport every class in the game knows we have just become a glass pylon and are easy to catch and out maneuver.  Need evidence look at the SOLARE rankings how many Awakening wizards do you see even in the top 20 wizards, in most matches they see an Awakening wizard and quickly 3v1 him as they can either kill him quickly or he gets one teleport off and then he dies tired a few seconds later. Then it's a 3v2. Teleport and Ultimate Teleport should have the same cooldown.\n\nWizards need a block besides S-block, the only time we are protected is when slowing stepping backwards or performing a skill that generally has a long cast time with limited options to cancel. In small scale combat you are essentially forced to make the first move, as you are standing there unprotected ready to be picked off. If you find yourself against a class with longer range like a ranger or archer most of the time you can't even close the distance with a teleport before they get a long distance cc on you.\n\nClass modifiers, honestly I think in general these should go away. You will never balance classes effectively when you have this many things to tweak. At lower GS levels these make a small difference but at the upper GS levels they are unforgiveable if you have 2 players at 700+ GS but one player does 15-20% less damage to his opponent and his opponent does 10% more damage to you then you are already at a severe disadvantage. Add to that one class that has major mobility challenges and another class that does not you get 1v1s that are just not winnable, regardless of skill.\n\nMagical Shield, this skill is pretty much useless even if you get the extra MP from lightstones, in a 1v1 scenario there are times where it can be helpful but in larger scale settings your Mana pool goes from max to 0 almost instantly so you are pretty much a grass beetle at that point. Increase the MP cost to cast this skill and remove the consumption of MP based on damage.\n\nSpellbound Heart, can we just make this last 1 hour or make it a passive, it just a pain to cast every 10 mins considering it has a cooldown of 30 secs clearly the intent if for this to always be up.\n\nSpeed Spell, would be nice to not have to constantly be casting this, without this our cast times and movement speed are horrible so it's something that needs to be up much of the time. It would be great to split this up so that the buff to the caster lasts longer but the allies portion can still last 30 seconds.\n\nMagical Evasion, this should have SA on it every time or even an iframe, this would help with our ability to survive while in close. Currently it has SA the first use with a 5 sec cooldown after that first use its a glorified bunny hop. There is nothing magical about this."

The animation of the ball can be seen traveling through the air at very high speed and ultimately detonating on the target to deliver the payload. But there is an incongruence with what is seen on the screen and what actually happens and it's not due to desynchronization/lag (desync). The problem: if the sorceress dies within one second after her projectile detonates, all damage and effects from the detonation ends up being canceled/nullified even though it is clear to see on screen that the projectile detonated after the sorceress died. Please fix this so that her projectile does deliver the payload ALWAYS after it detonates, regardless of if the sorceress died before hand. You can see many other classes like Wizards, witches, strikers, etc. whose skills will still detonate well within one second after they died; Having sorceresses' final attempt count is only fair and important so that what happens on-screen (the detonation of the projectile after the sorceress dies) is congruent with what you would expect to see in reality, which would be that if a projectile hits, it's payload delivery is not dependent on if the fun was destroyed after the the projectile was shot.\nIn fact the problem is much more severe than this. EVEN IF the sorceress is still alive when her \"Dream of Doom\" detonates on her target, it takes about 0.5 seconds for the projectile detonation to affect the enemy; and if the sorceress dies within that time-frame, then the detonation is also canceled even though the animation clearly showed it did detonate on target WHILE THE SORCERESS WAS STILL ALIVE. Please fix this discrepancy.\nThere is a very similar issue with the \"Grim Reaper's Judgment\" skill (GRJ), although the time-window of the discrepancy is shorter. If a sorceress dies within about 0.5 seconds AFTER she releases GRJ, any damage/effect from her GRJ is nullified even tho it clearly was cast on the enemy by looking at the animation. This is not due to desynchronization/lag.\n\nP.S.\nI forgot to mention that the cancellation of the payload also happens if the sorceress gets CC'd right after she has already thrown skill out. So this problem happens not only if the sorceress dies but also if she gets CC'd. This should also be fixed."

Sometimes her HP is very low, for example 10%, and she then uses these skill but the enemy can still hit her after she has already disappeared from the screen because the casting Super Armor lasts more than it should and the iframe part of the skill doesn't activate the moment she has disappeared. Therefore, by changing the Super Armor part to Forward Guard, this would allow the sorceress to skillfully aim her block skill towards the enemy and protect herself while waiting for the iframe/invincible portion of the skill to activate. Indeed, she can even be grabbed shortly (0.5s) after she has already disappeared from the screen, because the iframe/invincible part of the skill activates too late compared to when she disappears."

Heilang has been nerfed and bug ridden since the rework despite his new mechanics clearly taking a large percentage of our dev time during reworks, and they still don't work at all. In the first week of reworks, seen in the video, you could use the re-worked Heilang effect traps as described to a degree but ever since the patch December 29th only one week later which claimed to fix a whole bunch of stuff with the Heilang effect traps, you no longer could expect them to CC anyone. Every patch that deals with a Heilang effect CC since then has failed to achieve the stated result in the patch notes, such as \"removed the only CCs on last hit\" or \"fixed Heilang falling over due to damage or CC from enemy players\" which are both still issues, in addition to all but the last hit of these Heilang effects appearing not even to attempt a CC on players within their animations. Please fix these problems with the use of Heilang, as counter to the stated intent of the reworks we have become a class that cannot expect any help whatsover from their \"partner\" or \"class identity\" as a beast master. When Heilang gets a CC I am surprised, as in all the many hours of testing Tamers have done we still have not found the reason these skills no longer CC as they did before reworks, or as they did during that first week after reworks, for whatever reason. When I was under the impression this was working and wanted to share with other Tamers how it worked, I shared this video, that I later took down when it became clear this wasn't getting fixed. But, in the hopes that this request will be taken seriously and because it describes what should be working adequately including footage of how it should be working and how it did work, here is the video about Heilang AI mechanics I had previously taken down: https://youtu.be/GhkD9UFxTyU"

Every class feels like they can choose to completely ignore us in some way. __This also applies to AoS__, we are ignored pretty frequently because we're easy to evade, out pace, and stay away from so they can focus on our other teammates who sometimes don't play around us (but also they shouldnt be forced to revolve the whole match around us, but they have to because we can't keep up the pace)**PvE**, Our trash loot per hour / monster killed per hour is effected greatly by this as well, the ratio between other classes in the game to our trash loot is very significant ranging from 30-60% more depending on the location, even more so on spots that are one ability kills. Our stamina and even **movement speed** is destroying our rate of progression. It almost feels like a punishment to play this class because other classes are progressing in silver significantly faster which progresses their gear faster than us.**Disengage**, With all that noted above, we cannot disengage from a fight, we are locked in until we win or lose, because we can be chased down immediately and punished for even trying to create a distance since our second dash is unprotected and we can be CC'd during its slow mobility.\n**__Axian and Non-Command: Skills__**** Axian's health drain** doesn't make sense in all honesty, if we're supposed to be a tanky protected class, why are we consuming a ton of HP potions just to attack? which also puts them on cooldown while others are attacking us. When we trade attacks with another player, we are helping them do more damage to us just because of Axian. If our HP is low enough, we are forced to essentially kill ourselves. A removal of this would be great.**Axian's enrage**, this barely provides support/help. It removes him from our command skills making us do less damage, while he will also consume our CC limit on our opponent (most of the time) at a very bad timing, and get us killed this way. While I get buffing this makes people want to do AFK strategies in the past, I think a complete rework on this skill would be better.\nMy suggestion on reworking this would be; \"on Axian enrage, damage he deals now life steals up to XX%\" to balance this, place a decently sized cooldown so that it would only be useful once or twice in a long fight (maybe 3-4minutes?) This would provide him protecting us, and helping us fill our role. Similar to a way succession Drakania works but with a cooldown period.\n**Non-Command: Skills**, Most of these are not used at all because they offer no damage or buffs.\nPrime: Bitter Reign - Low damage, slow animation\nSuggestion: Buff PvE damage, and add a monster pull/aggro\nAffliction: Low damage, no use in combos\nChain Strike: Low damage, no use in combos\nSuggestion: Buff PvE damage, ability speed, and flow in to every command skill in and out\nPrime: Vengeful Star: Low damage, very slow animation,\nSuggestion: Buff PvE damage significantly, speed up the animation, add an accuracy buff or evasion debuff, and make it flow with every command skill in and out.\nStorming Star: extremely long animation, low damage, Suggestion: Make it a Prime Skill, add more hits, more accuracy, buff PvE damage significantly, increase cancel speedPrime: Swooping Ring: clunky animation, low damage, doesn't flow in to other skills enough\nSuggestion: Make it able to be canceled immediately with all command skills, add utility to it (accuracy buff or evasion debuff), PvE damage increase.\n\nNone of these abilities need to have more damage for PvP since our actual combos for PvP do adequate damage, but for PvE they really need help.\nI mention an evasion debuff / accuracy buff on one of the skills because we do not have one at all, and our accuracy vs evasion targets even with accuracy accessories struggles. Also things like crypt of resting thoughts are an extremely low hit rate for us because of this\n\n__**For PvE Specifically**__\n**All Command Skills**The damage and combo potential just isn't there, and our trash loot in zones where you don't require mobility really show it.\nSuggestion for helping us enter competitive PvE gains;\nGive our summons back their PvE crit rate, even if its just 50%. With it being 50% we still require skill addons + using face the darkness to keep 100% up. Most, if not all classes have 100% PvE crit rate in some form. Our PvE crit rate on skills do not effect our summons, only nova's damage strictly, this is making our damage considerably lower.\nAdding skills to better flow in to other non:command skills such as our rabams, Face the Darkness, and Quoratum's Ascension would also help with combos, and slight mobility within the packs.\nAlso allow crit damage to effect our summons in JUST PvE our PvP damage is perfectly fine.\nThis also points back to how other classes are able to get 30-60% more trash loot than us depending on the zone, the ones with no to low mobility the % is more around 30-50% in these 281 - 310ap zones.\nClasses blue loot scroll are our gold loot scroll, and their gold is our gold + agris. The gap is wide for the majority of classes, and anyone that happens to be in a 10-15% difference also needs a PvE buff.\n__**Passives and Buff Skills**__\n\n**Prime Distorted Guard:**This skill is never used seriously. It overwrites our Face the Darkness crit rate buff, and gives us less DR, Most people take the non-prime version to get just the 50 DR instead.\nOur class buff in general is very weak compared to other classes. It barely provides any extra tankyness. If you compare to something like Striker who not only gets 50DR, but 30% attack speed, 30% all res, and 15% evasion which can make him greatly more tanky than any shield class, significantly more classes have a very good, strong and powerful buff ability, While we are getting JUST extra DR. The crit rate on the prime version just make us not press F for 30seconds? that's not helpful or strong or even good.\nMy suggestion to this is to make it give a flat 150 - 200 DR, OR keep the 50DR, then add 30% attack speed, 30% all res, and 20% movement speed. One suggestion makes us able to tank a few hits the other helps us get our slow moving damage out\n**Quoratum's Vigor:** This passive is not useful at all. It only works outside of combat and makes no sense or synergy to have. It needs to be completely changed\nThe only suggestion I can have for this skill, is to either make it work during combat and activate every 5 or 6 seconds, or change it to add another +200 max HP since our max HP for being the slow moving wall is very low compared to something like Guardian / Drakania.\n\n__**PvP**__\nOur damage is perfect when it comes to command: skills. Any less it would ruins us, and any more it would over tune us. Non: command skills is up to PA's thoughts for PvP, but could open up more combos for us if they chose to. the only issue is the speed at which we can use our damage, but that's OK, since we are able to remain protected.\n**Winter Tetsudo** This skill needs a Forward Guard. It can almost never be used, and it's an extremely slow animation.\n**Absolute: Punishing Trap** This is our Grab skill, it's unprotected on use AND on success, but when it fails it's protected but it PULLs us to the enemy and puts us in their grab range instead. \nSuggested change: Either remove the stamina cost and the dash on failure, or add SA on success. We are the only class that doesnt have protection on a successful grab. We are the ones punished for using the skill in anything thats not 1v1. \n\n__**Current Issues**__**Broken Block** Currently when block is broken, we are unable to dash, and have to WALK to try to get away. its instant death, theres no chance for attempting to attack and do anything, doing something that applies FG resets the block broken animation and DEBUFF. My suggestion is to remove FG from the dash, and keep SA while ticking the debuff down to give us some sort of fighting chance to reposistion. Survivability will still be a very low chance, but it can be very frustrating to not be given a chance at all. \n\n**__Misconceptions About This Class with balance touch up ideas__**Many Players don't understand how this class summons work, and many hate post in here asking for complete removal of skills, CC's, and the like. So here's a chance for people to learn, and for whoever takes this information down for balance isn't compiling information from people who don't play this class at all. Icy Prison: Commonly mistaken as a \"pet auto CC\" This skill is her S+E, and is a delayed cast. It targets the closest player to you (sometimes a dead body) and applies a float to them after axian flies off. When you point your mace, your target is now marked by the skill, and in 2-3 seconds will be attacked. Sometimes if you have someone targeted but someone is closer it will overwrite who you targeted or sometimes just fly over our Nova's head. This skill is also unprotected, and has extremely minimal damage which is fine since it applies a long range CC.Sugesstion to help curve peoples distaste for this skill, is to remove it targeting the closest person, and to make it target EXACTLY the player we meant to target, and then when a target is not active, make axian fly directly above where the crosshair was/would ping at. This would provide commited intention use to the skill, while also providing a more skillful prediction of where someone is going. Keep the delayed casting. \n\nCommand Opening: This skill has the same animation as Icy Prison, but it's protected, places pawns on you, and axian overhead. All hits during this skill apply stiffen from the pawns + axian. Many people think its the summons doing this all on their own. but this skill has a 2second cooldown, and does little to no damage. It also will rarely land its stiffen on a skilled player because if youre respecting and paying attention to the summons you'll be fine it's very predictable. No change suggestions on this skill, it's not useful in close range, and if it does land a CC long range there's nothing useful for us to follow up on with it, its only helpful use is to get you off your groove / get a ranger or archer to stop their pummeling for a short time.\nThe Summons In General\nThese little guys go to your last location known just like all BDO mobs, when they teleport, and you move, theyre where you just were. Learn new combos, adapt, and pay attention to patterns and you'll be able to fight. Many players attempt to fight us with whatever combo they learned on youtube that works for 90% of the other classes out there, us being different has made players very vocal. \nAxian pattern with enrage: 2 pop ups that CC (and ruins our CC limit and combo) then a DPS roarPawns: 2 stabs (that applies 4 attacks) then a small afk\n\nCurrently we have noticed Pawns not CCing when our block is being hit (but CCing when we're not being attacked) either this is inteded or a bug, but I am fine with it being either way since the summons are not CCing players when we are attacking, it's our skill doing the CC's.\nIf this is a bug, and the pawns are supposed to CC no matter what, then the removal of this is fine since everyone but us has a protected grab now, it was only ever helpful during the time no one had protected grabs. Anyone CC'd by them otherwise is just not playing how they should versus Nova.\n\nThis class is not randomly or automatically playing itself at all, but because all the skills are \"raise shield, ice floor\" or \"point mace forwards\" people don't see that we can use 12 skills that basically all look similar and it makes the summons do things as part of the skill animation. \n\nThank you for reading"

        "content": "Family Name: VenerateRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Maehwa AwakeningSuggestion: Fix the Stamina/ SA+FG and grab counterplay\n\nMaehwas kit is very outdated. With the massive overprotection of classes Maehwa has become an SA trading class versus the fast catch class she was years ago. Since the harsh cuts to her movement she has been low to mid tier. The damage gained from reworks was promptly removed and she is now in a state where other classes can perform her job better. This class is supposed to dash around and reposition but doesnt have the tools to do so efficiently. Zero counterplay given against SA FG classes. Zero counterplay to grabs.\n\nThe implementation of blanket changes were bad for the class too:\n1. \"If it cc's its unprotected unless its a bon\" Other classes can use their preawaken for good cc's while Maehwa was given ZERO SA cc's in\n    her preawaken. Meanwhile grabs becomme PROTECTED cc in addtion to bons. Which means awakening grab classes get ANOTHER \n     protected cc in awakening. She has a couple (and i mean a couple) usable FG skills and all of her rabams add little to nothing.\n2. \"Slows capped at 50% for all classes\" While this is a good change for the game overall, this does nothing to deal with the fact that\n    Maehwa suffers from slows FAR more than other classes. This change was the response to people complaining about slows and for\n    Maehwa its not enough. The class completely falls apart once slowed. And because the last useable iframe (chase iframe is not\n    timeable/functioning) is now hardlocked with an unprotected animation the class has become strictly SA/FG. This means that it will take\n    damage at any point a skill is directed at it.\n3. \"Guard break for non grab classes\" I have zero clue what the thought process was here. Am i supposed to throw my skills into a frontal\n     guard so my damage gets soaked up? Did they think the other class would just sit there and take it? Also, adding flat guard damage\n     take a much higher toll on classes with weaker FG's. It seems that this was supposed to be a \"solution\" of some sort but its just bad. You\n     know what INSTANTLY cuts through FG? Grab. One button. Period.\n\nI thought about writing a breakdown about every single skill but I'll just talk about things that are tilted so far in other classes favor that it needs to be fixed.\n\nSA FG classes: These classes can literally just stand there and win. All it takes is a single grab and they can fully combo off of it every. single.\n                        time. They know this and dont even need to look at you when Q blocking (warriors for example). They dont even need to\n                        care which direction they face when they do it. When they come towards a Maehwa you have to run preempively because\n                        you dont have iframes to deal with grabs and some have much higher burst movement or sustained movement.\n\nGrabs:  The cd change was the worst way possible to \"balance\" this. Dodged one grab? They have another. The time between grabs is not \n             always 15s. There needs an intentional mechanic to counter this. BDO has become braindead with people dashing in to grab spam.\n             Failed grabs give a one second window of being unprotected. Some have backdashes and some have cancels to minimize their\n             failure. Only time you cant be grabbed is in iframe or while grabbing someone else (the irony...). Not to mention grabs given to\n             beserker that hold you in place while you V and then still allow for combos. Grabs need to count towards cc cap. The risk reward\n             ratio is way off. Awakening grabs should be unprotected.\n\nSlows. Like I said affect this class much more than others. It has no movespeed buff to counter slows or anything really. Other classes can\n            easily catch up once one of the many slows (+addons) is applied. Chase is supposed to allow us to reposition and move around but\n            you basically become a sitting duck\n\nTerrain. People sitting on a rock or anything that requires the slow unprotected climbing animation are immune to this class. You just get to\n              watch them spam skills from a distance. Feels great\n\nSkills. Ill just mention the most egrigious ones:\n\nStigma: Can never tell how far ill move back when i try to use it to counter someones FG behind me. Sometimes it just stutters me in place, \n              sometimes i just bounce off of the person directly behind me and once a slow is applied the chase cancel falls apart. Also the tip\n              flow out of this... Why? Huge gap and not a follow up to a stiff at all. Whats the purpose of this?\n\nBON Moonrise:  SA fails on this skill frequently resulting in getting cc'd. This bug needs to be fixed\n\nChase:  Everyone knows the Iframe is just a word in the skill description. I cant even begin to count the amount of times it did nothing.\n\nBow skills: In a much worse spot that before. Rework was a massive downgrade. needs to be reverted\n\nRabams: Slow and forward moving frontals are bad. The first one is an unprotected hp pot and/or downsmash. The tornado rabam just\n               drops frontal and cant be cancelled. Last one is unprotected. Doesnt stack with sleet steps. Worthless. All of the rabams are pretty \n               much F-tier\n\nSleet steps. Still waiting on iframe off CD and SA on cd. This skill is used to repostion Petal boom, buff attack speed and cancel red moon.\n                    So many uses for this skill and no protection on it on CD. Shame\n\nTL;DR Class is in a bad state cause the game moved on from the old classes and she wasnt brought up to speed to deal with it."

        "content": "Family name : RGB_Jackal\nRegion (NA/EU) : NA\nClass: Dark Knight Awakening and Mystic Awakening\nSuggestion: Change (at least) the outgoing damage modifiers against fist classes, succession nova, and warrior/valk, and buff Touch of Exploitation for PvE. Awakening Mystic needs damage buffs and bug fixes, and another idea regarding the class' evasion passive\nDetails: While I appreciate all the buffs that DK awakening has received since the reboot (I played this class years ago, only after it's reign of terror and was practically forced to roll off of it, despite it being my favorite playstyle of class), this class still performs unreasonably poor against Striker/Mystic, Warrior/Valk, and Succession Nova (More on nova in a moment). Regarding Strikers and Mystics, they are simply too tanky against Dark Knights, such that an evenly geared and skilled DK versus either fist class will practically have 0 chance of winning, because of some arbitrary percentage modifier. I understand that the fist classes were released just after DK and were designed to be mage-killers, but if memory serves me correctly, DKs lose about 25% damage against these classes, while Striker/Mystic GAIN something like 9% or 10% against them. Personally I don't really mind the fact that they deal more damage to DKs, but the -25%ish damage loss just seems rediculous to me, and should be toned down a bit! It's simply so oppresive to the point where the DK stands almost no chance at all. Witch and Wizard have a similar issue, but it's not as pronounced. Regarding Warrior/Valk, the issue still exists, but shows itself differently, particularly with Warrior, as Warrior has some pretty nutty tech that they can do that makes it easier to deal with DKs to begin with (Not to mention the grab and the very strong Forward Guard).  \nNow, onto Succ Nova. For context, my guild leader (Who mains succ nova) and I once decided to see how long she could keep me back in BA. As a 281 ap DK, versus a 380ish DP succ nova (DR), I simply was not able to break her guard due to her being able to stun/cc with pawns and other skills in the kit, thus stalling me out long enough to regen the guard meter, on top of simply not hitting the shield hard enough to cause any significant damage. This test continued for about 45 minutes before I simply gave up. As for the solution to this, I couldn't tell you, but there is something seriously wrong with this. Though this would probably be a bit busted, giving awakening DK some SLIGHT guard meter reduction on some skills might go a long way for making it more difficult for Q-block classes to simply stall and grab DKs into oblivion, without making it so that Q block is wholly unviable when fighting them. \nRegarding Touch of Exploitation, it's got the makings of a good skill; Sort-of lingerable forward guard, HP regen, decent range for what it is, and a not-terrible cooldown, but it just doesn't do enough damage to be seriously used as filler for DK PvE combos. Turning up it's PvE numbers while raising the PvP numbers to be roughly the same damage (If not a little more, as the skill is rarely ever used in PvP in my experience) I think would not only be justified, but a good change. Period. More skill-combo variety is always good for the longevity, playability, and probably most importantly, fun factor, of a class.\n\nNow talking about suggestions for awakening mystic, there's too many bugs with the class, there's a practically useless skill in the awakening tree, and awakening needs PvP damage buffs as it feels like I'm hitting people with gauntlets made of baked mostacholli. Additionally, I think it would be cool if Striker and Mystic also have an alternate selectable passive instead of the innate evasion boost (you can choose between either, but not both) that boosts DR rate, or straight up gives DR, instead of Evasion rate, thus changing the defensive-flavor of the class and making more people able to play them without having to spec into evasion gear. I'm definitely a little biased here as my main is DK, which uses DR, I also think this would help the players that don't have the resources to spec into evasion, making the class (again, particularly awakening mystic) more viable for lower-end players. Of course, one \"spec\" is absolutely going to end up stronger than the other (probably evasion), but the point of this is so that DR awakening mystic doesn't suck, and is actually useable, and yes I'm aware of the DR Succ-Mystic build that *kind of* works. But seriously the main issue with Awakening Mystic is that it just doesn't do enough damage, and has a lot of bugs with \"Please try again later\" or whatever that error message is."

        "content": "Family Name: HaplenRegion: NAClass: Sorceress (Awakening)Suggestion: Sorceress pve and pvp skill improvements.Details: The suggestions I have listed here are largely meant to improve pve, however they will in turn affect pvp though to a much lesser degree. My goal was to compare skill descriptions to better performing classes and analyze what exactly the differences were to hopefully try and understand why Sorceress is underperforming given, on paper, she has a lot that makes her powerful. In addition to this goal, I have included the current bugs I am aware of with instructions on how to reproduce the bugs. I wish I could speak as to what needs to be done with succession as well but for now I will just share my opinion regarding Awakening.Keep in mind as you read this: there are some classes that are pulling up to 50% more trash than Sorceress is capable of even when she’s going as hard and as fast as possible with more gear.Base Stats:- Base AP – Increase from 42 to 52. Sorceress is the only class set to 42, every other class is a minimum 10 AP higher.\n \nMain Hand:- Sinister Energy – Double the damage from (644% x1) to (1288% x1).- Absolute Darkness – Double the damage from (787% x2) to (787% x4) and speed up the animation by roughly 15%.- Dark Backstep – Allow for stamina recovery during use, also allow for quick slot activation. This is a skill requires we use an unprotected skill first for a small hop backwards, it should not be such a hindrance.- Bloody Calamity – Reduce cooldown from 20 seconds to 10 seconds and increase damage from (1396% x5) to (1396% x6). This would improve pve greatly as it is a tier 3 skill and would be excellent to proc damage to monsters off of.- Dark Flame – Increase distance travelled, increase the damage from (1178% x4, 1178% x2) to (1178% x4, 1178% x6), pvp damage -50%.- Ultimate: Dark Flame – Increase burn damage from 15 to 30 every 3 seconds, Knockdown added back to pvp.- Crow Flare – Currently bugged, the float cc does not apply after Midnight Stinger. Increase from (682% x5) to (840% x5).- Beak Kick – Increase damage from (340% x4) to (740% x4), remove bound cc, remove air smash. The cc and smash conflicted with one another while also nullifying the prior skill’s cc.- Mark of the Shadow – Increase damage from (365% x2) to (640% x4) and fix the bugged “Recover 4HP per hit”; currently you recover 4 HP per tick not per hit, it is ignoring the number of targets affected by the skill.- Shadow Eruption – Remove Super Armor and replace with Frontal Guard. Increase damage from (1101% x4) to (1101% x5).- Ultimate: Shadow Eruption – Match damage to Shadow Eruption and add Frontal Guard.- Dream of Doom – Currently bugged with terrain greatly determining how much damage will actually go through. Assuming fixing the bug doesn’t make a drastic difference: increase damage from (1383% x4) to (1383% x5 or possibly x6).- Bloody Contract – Increase HP recovery from (35 + 1x level of HP) to (35 + 2x level of HP).- Sinister Omen – Take everything in this skill and apply what it does to Signs of Agony. Could also just make the skill much faster and better explain what the skill actually does because most everyone is confused by this skill to include myself.- Storming Crow – Allow for stamina regeneration during use. When it was an iframe it made sense to not have regen on it, but it is no longer an iframe.- Shard Explosion – Increase damage per shard cost from (x1) to (something higher, testing required) and increase the animation speed. Given what this skill requires it should be a nuke and it’s not currently. Also consider fixing how it travels along the ground so it doesn’t blow up on terrain but rather on your target.Passives:- Dark Maneuver – Change “All Evasion Rate” to “All Accuracy Rate”- Dark Bound – Increase from (Magic AP +5) to (Magic AP +20) to match other classes, this is literally what wizard has.Awakening:- Shadow Leap – Add a flow, possibly two flows, that repeat the use of the skill but with super armor applied instead of iframe while using the flow version. If only one flow, set the cooldown to 7 seconds on that flow. If two flows, set the first flow to 7 seconds and the second flow to 9 seconds. - Vile Plan – Remove Stiffness CC from first hit, move Float CC from second hit to first hit. Add Forward Guard back onto the skill.- Dead Hunt – Currently bugged when attempting to use after certain skills; the second hit of dead hunt does not always activate as it should, usually this occurs after using Turn Back Slash. Add 40% Crit.- Violation – Add forward guard back onto the skill when off cooldown, this was the original design of the skill and is why the –dp buff is on it. Remove “Damage Reduced During Cooldown”, this is the main reason we grind slower than half of the other classes currently.- Flow: Soul Reaper – Remove Super armor and replace with Forward Guard. Increase attack 1 damage from (1380% x2) to (1380% x3).- Cartian’s Nightmare – Currently bugged. The Stiffness and push to pve does not work most of the time. Fix the aoe of the skill so that damage will apply not just to one specific spot a good distance in front of you, but instead apply the damage equally throughout the aoe. Specifically, allow proper damage to apply to enemies pressed up against and around you, the way it is currently I can’t kill anything in pve and it's slower than just using other skills.- Wings of the Crow – The forward guard is bugged and allows ccs to be applied while moving more often than not. Change Forward Guard to Super Armor.- Soul Harvest – Remove Floating on extra hits.- Blade of Darkness – Allow for the Blade summoned to attract 10 mobs once again, as it did when awakening was first released.Core Skills:Remove Core: Violation and replace with Core: Blade of Darkness (Super Armor while using skill).If for some reason Core: Violation isn’t removed and Forward Guard added back onto the skill, remove Core: Cartian’s Nightmare and replace it with Core: Blade of Darkness instead.Skill Enhancement:- Shadow Ignition – Increase damage from (872% x7) to (1072% x7).- Crow Nightmare – Increase damage from (598% x7) to (1198% x7) and decrease cooldown from 28 seconds to 14 seconds.- Engulfing Shadow - This skill is currently bugged such that when you are hit with a cc or debuff during usage there is a chance you will just stop moving, stand in an idle stance, and lose your super armor. To most easily reproduce this simply use the skill and have another player use Mark of The Shadow (Sorceress ability) on you. Additionally, the cooldown could be reduced to 5 seconds from 7 seconds given this skill generally only used for movement. - Abyssal Blow – Increase damage from (994% x5) to (1094% x5), change to forward guard to be active throughout the skill animation.- Shadow Hellfire - Change pvp reduction from -67.6% to -55%, add 100% crit. Reduce cooldown from 16 seconds to 10 seconds.- Shadow Wave – Reduce cooldown from 23 seconds to 12 seconds."

Nowdays, you feel more limited, because you have to run around and watchout for this cooldown to be used at the right time, rather than before, were we could keep it up at all times.\n\nMatch the range of archers & Witch/wizardRangers have decent damage, but if we fight melee, they close the gap in a blink of an eye, if you fight RANGED, as a RANGER, you can easily lose to being outRANGED. I see no reason why archers have longer range than ranger.\nLower the stamina cost of Will of the wind ( give it a prime version )Will of the wind will chunk your stamina cost if you are moving with it, will of the wind is rarely used in pvp in succession, and it would greatly help our mobility in pve, if the stamina cost was lowered, without it having any impact in pvp.Potentialy give it a prime version if you dont want awakening to abuse this in pvp.Lower the stamina cost on prime blasting gust IIIThe stamina issues is real if you try to grind effeciently, you have 2 options going from patch to patch, its either blasting gust ( and you are out of stamina before the 4th pack, or you put away your weapon and RUN, and you cant really sprint either, because will of the wind chunks away the stamina from the fighting. Make our 100% and 200% better than the skills themself without 100% or 200%\nvery simple, not asking for rangers to be a BSR god, but as it is right now, our charging wind deals more damage WITHOUT black spirit rage, and is litterily not worth the animation on it.our descending current deals atleast double the damage our 200% BSR descending current does.\nour 100% and 200% is an absolute joke.\nGive razor wind Health on hit\nSuccession ranger have 0 sustain, and for rangers from 0 to about 650 gearscore is FORCED to grind low areas or spend money on frenzy draught - this is very frustating for rangers that either just want to grind with giant, like ANY other class in the game, or wants to grind higher end content.Giving razor wind health on hit wont be overpowered, and we ( rangers ) dont need to be forced to use health on hit as an addon.\nMake the animation on wind explosion shot fasterCurrently the animation is too long, to the point where it makes you feel stuck in animation, instead of feeling its an escape tool, make it go faster/further and it will actualy be a good kiting ability."

When using the skill Prime: Fiery Angel and/or chase, the class gets staggered pretty easily when fighting in open world, node wars, and/or seige. Mediah is pretty traumatizing in these cases. the same goes for musa's stub arrows. Regular stub arrow, absolute stub arrow, and quick shot into gale slash are fine, great mechanic by the way, but when aiming below or up high, the skills stub arrow: evasive shot and absolute : charged stub arrow still fires straight ahead. In terms of protection, its my personal opinion, the utility that you guys gave arrow grapple was very nice, but leaves the class alittle naked. I would suggest making the skill's activation faster and/or have it flow into rising storm faster or add a protection level the same as prime: crust crusher, where it has forward guard/super armor/iframe during movement only will the croud controling part itself isnt protected. Just so people don't complain about it being to overpowered/overtuned. Also add counter attack to the skill description, for a bit more damage. And lastly, the flows. the rabam skills pouncing dragon that links into storm slash and gale slash isnt fast enought to benefit from the air smash effect of pouncing dragon or its air attack modifier that storm slash and gale slash has. It only works if one absorbs the black spirit rage to gets the +25% attack speed/cast speed buff or a which ever class that gives that amount of speed or greater. And even then, its either a hit or miss. Other than stuff i mentions here, the class is pretty well rounded and I can see that their is no plan to adjust musa's stamina issue, which i kind of understand."

        "content": "Family Name: NanoRegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): BothSuggestion: Revert/turn Heilang's state to a functional oneDetails:Preface: The Reboots gutted Heilang to be an oversized cosmetic. The below outlines the issues why:- Heilang CC traps are really bitty and need to be looked at under-the-hood as their CC chance is super low. There is many videos documenting this across Reddit, Youtube, and the Tamer Discord. We hypothesise it is to do with Resistance/Ignore Resistance not being coded into Heilang at all. The findings are not always conclusive between players and will need proper developer in-house debugging to find the issue so do not take the player-found reason literally.\n- Heilang also does not do any player damage which was a source of a lot of Tamer's combo damage which has fell off in recent years and even more so post-reboot when Heilang was completely gutted. Whether this is to do with his Accuracy, Ap, or whatever - something went wrong during the reboot to make him do pathetic damage to players. Again, requires Developer time to find the issue. Heilang is intermittent with mobs too, but this is harder to test as a normal player. Tamer is not a Beast Master if the Beast in question hits like a wet noodle. \nProof: https://i.gyazo.com/82bffc4a896c5bbbb799dca23ad3c340 296ap vs 6dp.. Really?!- If the above can be achieved, you can remove the silly RNG CCs he does as no real Tamer main wants that toxic mechanic ingame and I'm sure it would alleviate some friction with the greater playerbase. This is not necessarily a revert but would probably be a welcome change. Nova can keep the silly CC when CCed mechanic, if Tamer can have her CC fields back. :)\nTLDR: Heilang needs addressed. Make Heilang functional. This can be achieved at the bare minimum by doing all of the above. I have kept these proposals in one post as they all rely on each other, and if one point isnt achieved without the others then the problem still remains. It's one big mess."

It did not negatively affect those who did not care about it. Removing it was a slap to the face for those actually invested into the class lore-wise - which we lack a lot of already.

There could be so many more cool things with Heilang too, but that would require post upon post to generate ideas - this idea existed and can be reimplemented easily.Finally, the Commanding animation for this Command only could be the Tamer playing the Flute like she used to.

        "content": "open close On: Sep 10, 2022, 17:22 (UTC), Written by SoluSoull\n\nFamily Name: СолуRegion: RUContent: atoraxion Suggestion: add the ability to go soloDetails:\nJudging by the databases, you are preparing the 3rd part of the atoraxion and it seems that it will be quite unusual, unlike the first two parts, but I would like you to finalize the first two parts.\nIt's not really popular, and it's not just the complexity, but rather the fact that every week you look for a party, and a party of players who play well and know the mechanics. Of course, there are those who have their own pack, KP and all that, but even among such groups, not all of them go and favor atoraxion.\n\nI propose the following changes.\nAdd the ability to close the atoraxion solo (alone).\nAt the moment, Atoraxion does not spend luck scrolls, it is difficult for many to find a party, and even if they find it, not everyone passes it quickly or even successfully.\n\nI suggest adding (and not replacing) just adding (alternative) the ability to close the player's dungeon alone (alternative solo passage instead of group, if the player does not have his own KP or does not want to look for a party), but in this case he will spend scrolls of luck.\n\nFor example: During the pharma hadum spots, special key fragments will fall with some probability, 10 fragments are needed to craft the key and depending on the type of atoraxion ...\nIf this is a seasonal or regular channel, then you will need to craft a special key with the help of 10 pieces of key fragments and one piece of a blue-rank luck scroll\nIf this is the Hadum (Elvia) channel, then you will need to craft a special key with the help of 10 pieces of key fragments and one piece of a yellow rank luck scroll\nAnd with this key, it will be possible to go directly through soul magic into the room with the boss, i.e. the player will not need to go through all the stages of collecting (farming) Lucretia's dagger, etc The player will be able to enter the dungeon alone and close it.\n\nOf course, the mechanics of the bosses themselves are set up so that you need to go through together, there are stages where two or more players participate, what to do with them?!\n\nIn Vaamakia, remove the mini-games and other parts of the mechanics. Let Lucratia immediately appear together with the rider together, and not separately. The player will initially have a limited amount of time to kill the boss, for example 10 minutes, if he cannot kill the boss in 10 minutes, he will have to start over.\nFrom time to time, spheres of different colors will appear at different points in the room with the boss.\nYellow, adds +2 minutes to the time\nRed, increases player damage by 30 seconds\nGreen, restores the player's HP to 100% and, as a buff, restores the player's HP by 300hp every 2 seconds for 30 seconds Blue, buffs the player to defend for 30 seconds.\nPurple, the boss freezes, and his defense decreases by 10 seconds\nAll spheres of 1 piece each appear at once, they do not move but stand still, each time each color appears in different places, you can take (activate) only one sphere, when one is activated, all the others disappear until the next appearance.\nAlso, when these spheres appear, the boss himself also flickers with one of these colors, and if the player takes a sphere of the color that the boss is flickering with, this buff gets the boss and not the player\nYellow, reduces the time by 30 seconds\nRed, increases boss damage by 30 seconds\nGreen, restores boss HP by 20%\nBlue, buffs the boss to defend for 30 seconds.\nPurple, the player gets a strong slowdown for 30 seconds\nthat is, the player will need to take the spheres of the color that is not currently on the boss and at the same time do not forget the time and calculate everything so as to kill the boss before the time runs out. And at the same time not to fall for his strong attacks.\n\nIn Sikarakia, also remove all the mini-games and mechanics, as well as add a timer for killing the boss for 15 minutes.\nThe player, as well as in the usual party passage, can change the level of the boss on the plate, where his damage increases and his defense decreases, and vice versa.\nIn addition, on 6 tiles on the floor (the location with the boss is divided into 6 parts, like pizza parts), fish appear on each plate at the beginning, which will move to the boss and disappear if they touch the boss, the player does not have to kill them, but for each killed + 1 minute is added to the time.\nAfter, during the battle, different numbers appear on the tiles on the floor, for example: 20-38-15-40-11-55, each plate has its own number\nthe player will need to look at two other standing plates, on which there will also be numbers, for example: 10 and 5, the player needs to add and the answer will be 15 and stand on the stove, on the floor with the number 15, if he does everything correctly, the player will receive increased protection for 30 seconds, if not, 2 minutes will be taken away from the remaining time.\nNext, a game with colors(which already exists), where the boss is alternately summoned in different colors, white, blue, yellow, red. If the player guesses which color was called more than others, the player gets a buff for an increased attack, otherwise, 1 minute of the remaining time will be taken away.\nThen the boss closes in the energy barrier, and does not receive damage (like a thunderstorm kutum). 6 squids will appear around, one in each plate on the floor, they are standing still. The player can kill all the squids and the energy barrier will fall and it will be possible to beat the boss further. Or kill squids in the sequence that will be indicated on two standing slabs, in this case, the player will receive a buff for damage and defense, but it will take 30 seconds from the remaining time.\nAnd at the end there will be two scorpions, one will have a high defense but a low attack, the second vice versa\nThe player will need to quickly kill a scorpion with low defense but high attack, from this scorpion the player will receive a damage buff, and will be able to quickly kill a second scorpion with high defense and low attack.\n\nI want to summarize right away, these methods of passage will not replace the current state of the passage of dungeons, but will simply add a second alternative method of passage for those who want to close solo and fight only with the last boss. Of course, in order to go solo, you need to go through the storyline at least once per account, which can only be done in a group of 5 people.\n\nThus, players will start spending their accumulated luck scrolls, and those who do not have them will start buying\nEvery week, you can pass twice each atoraxion, i.e. a maximum of 4 passes, this is either 4 ordinary blue-rank luck scrolls, or even 4 yellow-rank scrolls.\n\nMoreover, you can, for those who have a premium set, once a week, every Thursday, for each dungeon, give out one ready-made key to choose from, for a regular passage in a regular channel or a complex one on the hadum (elvia) channel, they will craft two more by spending good luck scrolls (if they want each danj close twice) Of course, in order to craft, as already mentioned, you also need fragments of the key, if you craft all 4 keys yourself, you will have to farm 40 fragments of the key every week, this is still + where you will need to spend scrolls of luck. And with the premium set, you will need to farm 20 shards and spend only 2 blue or yellow rank luck scrolls if the player plans to close 2 times each dungeon every week. Or maybe just get two ready-made keys every week through a premium set to choose from and close each dungeon once.\nAlso, from time to time, it will be possible to distribute these keys through achievements or calendars.\n\nThere will be more players who will pass the dungeons, because the boss battle is the most interesting, and the key will give you the opportunity to skip the farm of Lucretia's daggers, etc., players will be able to immediately fight with bosses and spend their luck scrolls. And most importantly, it will take not an hour of time, but 10-20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes at most, and they will receive quite generous awardsalso now there is a very severe shortage of Memory Fragment\nthis would allow players to get a good amount of these items\n\n\nThere us no shortage of memory fragments\nThere's a shortage of people that want to waste time running them. You want fragments? Buy some scrolls and go run them. I promise you will get double what you would pay to buy them straight  up.\n\nYes this post will prob be removed but figured I would let you know where to get them."

EVERYONE FAVOURITE, THE COLORS: It's working as intented nowadays, in the early stages of the dungeon was some issue with it, but now its working fine, so no need changes just walk with the colors, and that's all, that means no movement skills should be used in the process.

It's your damage and movement, up to the player how to use it. Last time the shard system got improved, was when they added shard-gain on Tidal Wave (shift+rmb) for PvE. However I would like to see some changes that improves shard usage in PvP.\n\nOutdated skills having shard usage.\nThere are a couple of pre-awakening skills that still have shard consumption where there should not be. This is due to the fact that this used to give damage to pre-awakening back in 2017. However ever since succession and especially after reboot came out, it is essential to use shards in awakening only and not in pre-awakening when it comes to damage.\n\nChanges\nMy suggestion is to remove shard consumption from the following skills: Flow: Savage Fang, Absolute: Sweeping Kick. It's a big waste to consume shards with these skills. Not having shard consumption lets the player use shards in awakening more. There is another skill that consume shards in pre-awakening, and that is Absolute: Roaring Tiger. I am not sure about this one, due to the fact that you can use this skill while generating your last shard for a 3 sharded Wave Orb."

        "content": "Family Name: DreadsparkRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Shai (Talent)Suggestion: How to rework Shai without Succession/AwakeningDetails:\nSA = Super Armor\nCD = Cooldown\nFG = Forward Guard\nFrom my experience Support in BDO is a curious discussion. Quickly I will describe the various supports, ordered from the best healer to worst, and then within each class, their best specialization to worst: Valk: Healing/Control | Caster: Control/Healing | Corsair: Guard Breaker/Healing | Shai: Buffing/Control/Healing\n\nThe issue for Shai is that every class other than Shai has good damage and survivability. Shai can do good damage with AP but will have no survivability, or they can build for survivability and have no damage. This is the core of the class's problem, her support can be powerful, but her major contributions are not in the form of healing. Instead, her best skills are SMS, Time to Shine (BSR), Bongos (less now than ever), Slows, and misty haze (3min CD makes this almost useless). Shai used to be able to play as the only true frontline support, but over the course of the reworks, she has lost her defenses and is now best an underwhelming backline class.\n\nThings that would greatly help Shai are pretty apparent from my above assessment. She could use more survivability via defensive passive, SA protection on her heals, SA and no collision on Yippee, Stamina cost removal from Hop III, SA on Shout to the Sky which will heal Shais for 2x the amount, Bubble changed to no longer trap players but instead removes projectiles (Similar to RBF Valencia) with the Shai no longer animation locked (more like how novas wall acts), New ability: Bubble breaker, Shai can use this skill to break the bubbles of other Shais, but it shares a cooldown with bubble. I like this idea because it creates a counter-play and choice which is what Shai is all about.\n\nIt is important to note that most if not all counter-play between supporting Shais were removed whenever we lost Misty Haze due to the long CD which makes the skill easily countered by grabs. In the past, Misty Haze was mainly used to deter frontline territory to enemy supporters such as Shai, Corsair, Valk, Striker, and Mystic. Most of this is gone with the 3min CD which is unfortunate to the point that this skill should be turned into a PvP-only ability and the cooldown reverted. \n\nRabaams... Just make Twirl-Boom a class skill with Super Armor. Make her first rabaams \"Over-There\" and \"Sharing is Caring\" permanent and immortal. Allow Careful to heal the Shai that casts it and give Tumble-Wumble Forward Guard with no gap at the start or end. \n\nCore Skills: These don't exist for Shai. Consider using them to add new and unique skills. One example of a skill that could have been a core is \"We're gonna win!\" since it changes the playstyle drastically.\n\nDamage ratios for Shais damage to Strikers and Mystic need to be brought more in line with all other classes.\n\nFinally Dream Donkey, without it all hope is lost and the night closes in.\n\nMy Changes are focused on assisting Shais to be more protected whether played as a frontline tank or AP Shai with changes focused on aiding both styles of support and adding additional emphasis towards group play both for Shais on a team and against those of an opposing team without taking away from other supports like Casters and Valkyries. \nPS: I recommend doing a full rework instead to create a succession and awakening kit because Sun-Moon-Stairs and Misty Haze are OP in PvE and break the game design, but the removal of these skills ruins Shai PvE and breaks the class design. Please see my other post #275 on Page 28 for more details on what can be done."

        "content": "Family Name: EmperiumRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Witch (Awakening)Suggestion: Changes to AbilitiesDetails:\n\n1. Change Mana Shield to be a toggle skill that consumes flat 25MP/s in addition to drain upon taking damage. I know that many awk mages want to see more mobility, but I think that the solution is in the opposite direction. The idea is that since we're so vulnerable to grabs, mana shield should not have an uptime of 50% but rather 100% with a higher cost to put the onus of moving in and out of fights on the player's awareness rather than the timer.\n\n2. Change Psyche of Aad Sphera (E-Buff) to have an effect matching the currently summoned pet. Tett should give AP to allies (like awk wizard) and Gorr should give DP to allies (like the current buff). If no pet is summoned, then it will default to DP buff to allies as it currently does. No changes to self-increased stats.\n\n3. Change Tectonic Block resistance to 7 seconds duration (5-> 7). As this skill currently works, the buff ticks down to 2 seconds before refreshing even while holding the block. That means if you move after holding block, you can have anywhere from 2-5 seconds left on your resistance buff despite holding block the entire time. That means I could hold block for 3 seconds, double TP, and the buff is already gone.\n\n4. Elementalization buff. Add a minor iframe linger to elementalization at the end. SA would be fine too. The rational is that almost every single other awakened witch skill lingers the protection until the Spheras stop spinning. The entire class kit is based around the ability to linger protection because we have no movement and it's extremely jarring that elementalization must immediately be followed by another skill. \n\n5. Fix Pet Summons. Ever since the re-work, there's been a ton of random things in NW and AoS that just randomly kill/damage the pet. I know cannons used to de-summon pets, but in AoS I'm guessing it's the map mechanics and in NW probably defense structures or traps. Also please change pets to be automatically summoned upon reviving in NW. It makes 0 sense that they were made to be a core part of our skillset but must be re-summoned everytime and starts the respawn protection timer.\n\n6. Fix pre-awakened absolute skills. Absolute Meteor, Blizzard, Lighting and others are just worse than their level 3 counterparts. \n\n7. Revert Thunderstorm change and give it back its stun without needing to choose it as a Core skill. Core Fissure and Core Detonative Flow are just too essential to pass up on and it seems like every class has so many protected CCs anyways so awakened witch can't even compete with her slow spells.\n\nSummary: Contrary to popular belief, I think that awk witch does do decent damage. The problem is that the class revolves around staying alive to dish out continuous damage and that's just impossible given the fast pacing of the current game. In AoS the only map that was good for awk mage (Cadry) was removed and the maps like Oluns or Manshaums are straight detrimental to awk witch playstyle. In NW/OW even at 730+ GS it's near impossible to get 2 skills out before disappearing."

        "content": "Family Name: GrimshineClass (Awakening/Succession): Tamer Awakening & SuccessionSuggestion: Essential awakening and succ improvements\nDetails: It's no secret Tamer is not in a great spot, but there are really only a few small changes which need to be made on both specs and Heilang to make her able to perform. She will still be the hardest class to play well, but those who persist will at least be rewarded for their efforts.\n\nHeliang:\n\nWe all know what is wrong here. Every tamer will tell you the same thing. Void Lightning and similar skills (of which we now have 4) do not work properly. They used to multi CC now it seems to be around 4 attempts to CC over almost a 4 second animation. This means its incredibly unlikely that you will ever catch someone in these traps and they are her primary utility for group pvp.\n\nI can gurantee if her void worked as it used to tamer would be getting so much less hate from people in arena of solare because her performance and group utility would be far better. Please revert this to how it was before the reworks or at the very least increase the number of CC hits on these skills to something more reasonable like 8-10. Heilang also shouldn't be able to get CC'd out of the animation. I don't think multihit CC is good for the game on most skills, but this skill in particular was designed for it to work that way and Tamer is no where near her full strength without it.\n\nAwakening:\n\n1. Add iframe to the flight of cloud ride. We get knocked out of this so often or hit stagger negates all movement and results in our death. Infernal nemesis on guardian is very similar but has the iframe and is a very reliable escape so there's really no reason cloud ride shouldn't have one too. If you arent going to fix us getting knocked out of the SA give it iframe.\n2. Make a noticable buff to her AOE on all skills in awakening. This is a crippling problem in both PVE and PVP. In PVP often we cant even reach our target after CCing them. It also prevents her from pressuring teams in solare with trade damage because even in the best case scenario she can usually only reach one player with her AOE. By needing to be so ridiculously close you are also taking way more damage and way more risk of being grabbed. In regards to PVE I genuinely believe her tiny AOE is one of the only things preventing her from competing with other classes.\n3. Change echo pierce core to celestial slam. Echo pierce in general is pretty useless and could do with a full rework. With increased AOE having an SA core for celestial slam it would give us a lot more versatility in group pvp and give us a safer combo for those 3v3 situtations. Tamer still doesn't really have a 100% safe combo for 3v3. Most other classes do.\n\nSuccession:\n\n1. Make a succ version of evasion which slightly increases the movement distance of WW and adds SA to the unprotected part of the skill. Succession cant run away from any class really and to even attempt to do so we have to spam a button which as a huge gap in it. This just isn't okay in modern BDO. The new version could have increased stamina cost for all I care but any succ tamer main will tell you this is almost always what gets us killed, either we just cant get away from someone or they just spam protected CC until they hit that gap.\n2. Fix whiplash - The damage is terrible and it barely sees any use even in PVE. Speed up the initial hits and make the last hit do much better damage. It also has annoying interactions when left unlocked, for example doing WW into W+RMB will do 1 hit of whiplash before the W+RMB comes out and will get you caught every time in pvp.\n3. Give fearful tremble signifnicantly more damage on the succ version so we have some kind of quick SA skill to trade with. Succession currently has zero SA trading capability and the game now revolves around it. In situations like solare trying to pressure with roaring will usually get you caught because its a FG. We need some kind of SA damage and short of changing the guard on roaring to SA I'd say tremble is the next best option. I would also be happy with SA roaring though.\n4. Fix skill links - Lots of skills don't link together properly. For example you can't do shift Q or Q after a lot of skills without a long delay, such skills are W+C, W+RMB etc. Its very awkward, you should be able to chain any combination of skills without an awkward delay and without the need to use bolt inbetween.\n\nAlso return the sit command for Heilang. How are we supposed to take cool screenshots without it?!"

        "content": "Family Name: FXVRegion (NA/EU): EUClass: Nova (Awakening)Suggestion: Awakening Nova BuffsDetails:\nPreface: These changes were written prior to this forum topic being opened and so follows a different format. I have sent the original PDF document to a community manager, if you would like the original PDF document then do not hesitate to contact me.\n \nIntroductionNova was meant to be a fast high mobility class with high burst. However in light of its past nerfs and with the introduction of the reworks, awakening Nova has become a former shell of herself, losing her entire class’s identity. It is now out sped by many classes and has extremely low damage as well as comparatively far less protection when looking at many other classes. It is simply not viable in the current meta.\nThis post outlines all the buffs, changes, fixes, and nerfs that would be required to make awakening Nova more balanced and viable in the current meta.\n \nAwakeningE-Buff:The awakening e-buff is one of the weakest in the game and was nerfed during the initial balance patches to make it even weaker.  Furthermore it is one of the only e-buffs in the game that incurs a negative de-buff when used; negative 500HP upon use. The 20 AP buff granted by the e-buff is extremely redundant as it does not stack with the 20 AP awakening Nova self-buff which you are able to easily apply to yourself with a 100% uptime.\nThe changes I propose are to remove the HP loss on the awakening e-buff, revert the Star’s breath recovery nerf from 25% back to 50% on the awakening e-buff, and to bring back the pre-awakening e-buff, being able to use it from hot bar while in the awakening state as you were able to initially in 2021. Having both awakening and pre-awakening e-buff at your disposal justifies the weakness of each buff and adds variety and depth to the class by allowing you to pick and choose which one to activate.\nEn Garde:The Engarde state was the staple and identity of the class, however in light of its numerous nerfs and in light of the class reworks, it has become a shell of its former self. as it currently stands; it takes 100 seconds to be able to obtain Engarde through orb consumption. Even so, Engarde is heavily unprotected and many players, including myself, opt to not even enter the state in many instances due to this, as the non-Engarde state provides much more protection. \nThe first and arguably the most vital change I propose is to make Engarde toggleable. Allowing you to enter and exit the Engarde state at any time, using whatever Star’s Breath you have at the time as a sort of ‘fuel’. For example; if you enter Engarde with 100% Star’s Breath and exit with 50%, you would have been in Engarde for 15 seconds. Furthermore, a cooldown should be implemented upon exiting the Engarde state, not entering. The cooldown should be in the range between 10-15 seconds. This should balance the usage of the Engarde state so it is not abused by entering and exiting constantly. The awakening was designed around Engarde, so to restrict access to it so heavily completely debilitates the class and is incredibly bad design. This toggle rework allows the player to access the bread and butter of their class at any point without having to sit around waiting for almost 2 minutes to gain access to it.  Additionally, it also adds a layer of depth to the class and increases the skill cap, as you will have to decide when and when not to enter or exit the Engarde state; having to manage your ‘fuel usage’. However, most importantly of all; it would make the class incredibly fun, and I believe the fun factor of a class is one of the most important considerations.\nThe second change I propose is in regards to the protection while in the Engarde state, as previously mentioned; many players opt to not enter the Engarde state due to its lack of protection. This lack of protection stems from the Engarde dashes. The Accel variants of Break and Twisted Orbit are much weaker compared to their non-Accel counterparts. Accel Break Orbit is on a 2 second cooldown compared to the 1 second cooldown of its non-Accel counterpart and Accel Twisted Orbit is on a 5 second cooldown compared to the 3 second cooldown of its non-Accel counterpart. Subsequent dashes in Engarde are also completely unprotected. This means that dashing after using the cooldowns leaves you completely vulnerable if you choose to attempt to move at all when compared to the non-Engarde state; which you are forced to do due to the nature of the class. It does not make sense at all for the Engarde state to be weaker than the non-Engarde state in terms of movement, the non-Engarde dashes are simply superior. There are 3 main approaches which would solve this issue:\n\nReduce the cooldown of Accel Break Orbit from 2 seconds to 1 second\nMake it so that the Accel Break Orbit dashes are super armour when the ability is on cooldown\nMake it so that when Accel Break Orbit is on cooldown, the normal Break Orbit dash is used and is put on cooldown when you attempt to dash in the Engarde state\n\nFrom all the approaches, I recommend the final approach as I believe it is the most balanced of the 3 and will make players think about their dash cooldowns instead of just spamming. \nFurthermore, the Accel Twisted Orbit cooldown should be reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds; the same as its non-Accel counterpart. These skills are essentially the same ability and there is no reason why the Accel variant should be given a longer cooldown considering that the Engarde state is meant to be a more powerful state.\nEven with the proposed toggleable Engarde rework, the Star’s Breath generation is far too low, with it taking 100 seconds through orb consumption to reach 100%. There are 2 ways to solve this issue. The first being to increase the amount consumed by orbs from 5% back to 10% as it originally was. The second option is to significantly increase the overall Star’s Breath generation through skill hits, as currently it is extremely low with some skills having generation as low as 0.1% to 0.2% per hit. I propose the latter option to be implemented, as this would heavily promote aggressive gameplay and reward players for actively fighting their opponents as opposed to the first change which would incentivise players to stay back and idle while consuming orbs. However as I have mentioned, a significant increase would have to be implemented as the current values are far too low.\nDamage:Awakening Nova in its current state does extremely low damage. The class was defined by its high burst damage; however it no longer exists and has not for well over half a year. As it currently stands; a hard cap Nova with anywhere from 309 AP to 323 AP fully buffed with draught is unable to even one combo many classes who possess similar hard cap gear, from 401 DP to 417 DP, such as Berserker, Warrior and Valk to name a few. This is not an issue of incorrect combos, incorrect crystal setups, incorrect addons or incorrect gear setups. Awakening Nova simply does not have the damage to kill these targets and fails completely to live up to its burst and assassin style gameplay. There is no burst or assassination. \nThe change I propose would be to increase damage across the board, there is no one specific skill which requires an increase in damage. This could be done through either buffing Nova’s damage modifiers to other classes by a significant amount, or through buffing the damage of each ability individually.\nCooldowns:As mentioned previously, awakening Nova suffers from very high cooldowns; causing the class to often idle and not do anything. While this problem in the most part would be resolved through the toggleable Engarde rework mentioned in the Engarde sub-section, the issue also largely lies in the Starfall ability. The Starfall ability is the source of majority of the damage for awaken Nova, without it you are simply not able to output any meaningful damage, let alone kill a target. This ability is placed on a very long 12 second cooldown. I propose to lower the cooldown to 8 or 9 seconds, this would allow Nova to more often output meaningful burst damage (burst damage being a staple of Nova) and would increase the overall DPS of the class.\nAs mentioned previously also under the Engarde sub-section, I propose that the cooldown of Accel Twisted Orbit be reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds, much like its non-Accel counterpart. There is no reason for this skill which is exactly the same as the regular Twisted Orbit to receive a higher cooldown, especially considering the Engarde state is a state meant to ‘Accelerate’ and boost the class’s performance.\nOther Skills:There is a bug that occurs in which the awakening Nova 100% BSR ability does not activate even though the BSR is unlocked. This more frequently occurs when in the Engarde state and attempting to ult with Accel Frozen Ring. This should be amended. As of writing this, I have not fully confirmed the exact conditions to replicate this issue.\nThe Accel variant of Fleche is not cancellable with dash as its non-Accel counterpart is. This makes the skill very clunky. It does not make sense for this specific skill to act so different when compared to its non-Accel counterpart, as no other skill’s Accel counterpart behaves this differently. This should be amended, and the Accel Fleche skill should be made to be cancellable with the dash.\nSimilarly, Brutal ring is also very clunky to use due to the fact you are unable to cancel out of it like you are able to with Frozen ring. This should be amended. \nSwooping Ring should be changed so that you are able to mouse movement it. Upon release of the class, myself and many other awaken Novas attempted to mouse movement this ability instinctively as the skill seemed to be ideal to take advantage of the mouse movement tool. Even still I find myself instinctively pressing CTRL to activate mouse movement when using this skill. Almost every other ability in the awaken Nova kit can be moved with mouse movement, so it does not make sense for this ability to be left out. Allowing mouse movement would add extra depth to the skill as you would be able to redirect the CC (if you are playing with the Core ability) and increase the skill cap somewhat. \n \nPre-AwakeningGrab:Changes were made to grabs so that upon successfully landing, the grab animation becomes super armour. However the Nova grab is not super armour upon landing and is the only grab in the game that experiences this issue. Given its extremely long grab animation; it is very easy to punish and extremely risky to use. This should be amended. \nThe Nova grab is the only grab in the game which consumes stamina. Awakening Nova is an already heavy stamina consuming class, and so the grab should not consume any stamina.\nFurthermore, the Nova grab is inherently extremely buggy. The grab often phases through players and does not act as it should. This should be looked into and amended as it is extremely frustrating to land a grab on a target only for it to be phased through the target or not hit at all (This is not a resistance issue).\nDash:\nThe pre-awaken dash of Nova is a very good ability to reposition yourself while in pre-awakening, however many players feel the need to lock this ability as you are unable to access the awakening dash which is vital to avoid grab CCs given its added i-frame. \nAbilities should not be needed to be locked for a class to function. The change I propose is to make it so that when in pre-awakening the side-to-side dashes and forward dashes are the pre-awakening dash, however when the player dashes backwards, it should activate the awakening dash. This gives the player choice in whether to reposition in their block or to enter back into their awakening smoothly or to i-frame a grab.\nBlock Stance:When blocking in pre-awakening, going straight into awakening, and then using the 3rd Rabam skill (Quoratum’s Earth), you are forced into the block. This is known as the block stance.\nThis makes it so that you cannot use other pre-awakening abilities straight after using Quoratum’s Earth, causing you in some instances to fail to kill a target. Being put into a block should not be automatic, this lowers the skill-cap of the class as players do not have to think about blocking since it is automatically done for them. It is also a source of frustration for the reason mentioned previously. \nMake it so that the class does not automatically block or make it so successive inputs take priority over the automatic block stance.\n \nNerfsI believe all of the changes mentioned in this document should be applied to awakening Nova, however in-exchange for these changes I believe Nova should sacrifice some of the tools it already possesses so that the class does not become too powerful.\nSuper Armor E-Buff:Currently the awakening Nova e-buff has a buff which places you in a state of permanent super armour for 10 seconds. In exchange for the buffs/changes mentioned in this document, this should be removed as it promotes unskilful play as you are able to stand up from grabs instantly and play without thought.\nThornwood Guards:Currently the Nova pre-awakening has pets which act on their own and automatically CC opponents without any input from the player. This too is extremely unskilful and is a great source of frustration for those who fight against Nova as the CCs that are incurred do not require any action from the player. These CCs even persist when the Nova herself is CCd or in emergency escape (V). These pets should be removed. Succession Nova should also be taken a look at in regards to this as well.\n \nConclusionThere are many other changes that could be made to awakening Nova to increase its viability in the current meta, however the ones listed in this post are the most essential and the ones that are required to be addressed in order to make the class viable. If you require more in-depth suggestions or explanations, then I am willing to participate in another AoA class round table at any time much like the one in the previous year."

        "content": "Family Name: KaliverRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening GuardianSuggestion: This class cannot be squishy, have little viable damage AND be incredibly slowDetails: As the suggestion says, having the lowest burst and sustained damage, while at the same time dealing it through incredibly slow super armor skills makes it very unrewarding to play in PvP. In mass pvp situations, you simply die in the startup animations of skills like cleansing flame or god incinerator. If you don't die, you get grabbed. If neither happen, you're playing against people who have just started PvP in BDO. Awakening Guardians needs a strength or two because currently it has none in endgame gear situations. Buffing god incinerator and searing fang does nothing to solve her problems.\nMost of my specific suggestions were essentially realized in Succession Drakania, so I have no idea where you'd want to go with this class now. You took away Awakening Guardians tankiness, her damage, what little healing she had, and then buffed all the strong rework classes through the ceiling (in addition to ranged damage just being strong always), so there's just no place for her currently. \nThis is not a matter of buffing a few skills and calling it a day."

        "content": "Family Name: Kuma_QueenRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Awakening WitchSuggestion: More protected mobilityDetails: After class reworks, I had high hopes for Awakening Witch to be strong in PvP. Awakening Witch is known for high damage output but very stand-still/low mobility. I couldn't stand to play her anymore because it's almost impossible to stay alive if you're getting chased or focused down. The main issue is, she's stuck in a lot of SA damages, and is proned to taking a lot of hits and getting CC'd in long animation frontals. Yes, she does have a 4 second CD magical evasion, but thats her only short CD protected movement for repositioning. There's also Elementalization, which is a nice repositioning skill but it's a very long cooldown and feels unreliable when getting ran down. \n\nMy suggestion to fix this problem is to either give her more protected mobility. I.E. making Magical Evasion an iframe off CD, and SA on CD, and to increase stamina usage on that skill to prevent the spamming of it. OR rework her skills to be more like BDO Mobile's \"Invoker\" which is basically the same as PC's Awakening Witch. \n\nAnother issue is her frontal animations such as Yoke of Ordeal and Equilibrium Break. While these skills are very strong in her kit, it feels like they lack the damage output for how long it takes to cast. These skills are also what make her feel like the \"sitting duck\" in PvP because you cannot cancel out of them fluidly. My suggestion to fix this is to just make longer animation skills such as these ones to be cancelled smoothly into other skills into her kit like Voltaic or Thunderstorm etc.\n\nHer damage in PvP feels lack luster compared to other classes who considerably got stronger with reworks. The damage output does not feel great in comparison to how much damage you take in return. Although Awakening Witch does have range spells, I feel like her awakening kit lacks the damage to keep up and follow up any of her own catches or CC's. (I.E. getting a KD with Meteor, following up with voltaic and thunder storm - if you decide to teleport in to follow it up, you're stuck and super vulernable to dying because lack of mobility) Basically what I'm saying is you're forced to use Teleport defensively because of her kit which makes it very difficult for her to play aggressively and get away with it.\n\nIt's a difficult class to offer suggestions without changing her whole \"style\". However, since BDO's meta is always changing, she has definitely fallen behind in PvP. I'll link a YouTube video of BDO Mobile's Invoker to show an example of how Awakening Witch could be \"restyled\" into something more viable for her in PvP.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpbC63mdpg8"

        "content": "Family Name: DudeauxRegion (NA/EU): NAClass (Awakening/Succession): Ninja & Kunoichi (both)Suggestion: Change how Ninjutsu: Shackles functionsDetails:\nShackles is one of the least-used skills in the kit. It's not that the skill is useless, it is just that the pay-off for the casting time is weak.It is an unprotected 50% movement slow that lasts 10 seconds, with a cool down of 20 seconds, and a full second cast time with the fastest attack speed possible. It really only exists as a way to get the enhanced skill \"Illusion of Restraint.\"It sees its most amount of use when an evasion-focused enemy gets knocked down, so that a re-CC is easier. This still isn't even a better or a common usage of the skill, just the only time I can really think of using it. If you're not confident you can finish someone, you throw this out.What if this skill became a lingering area of effect that applies movement slow to any enemy that enters is, instead of being a wide forward-facing attack effect?The slow casting time and mediocre damage wouldn't be so bad, and the skill would find use.If this were implemented, I believe more changes would be necessary to add to the skill. Perhaps cutting the effective debuff time from 10 to 5 seconds. Or keeping 10 second debuff timer, but decreasing the 50% slow to 30%.Considering that ninja's only attack slow is locked behind using a kunai(LMAO), I find that adjusting and replacing the basic movement slow of \"Dangerous blades of angry grass\" with \"caltrops,\" a cool ninja tool."

        "content": "Family Name: TENERegion (NA/EU): EUClass (Awakening/Succession): Archer awakeningSuggestion: Few changes in some skills, QoL changes and bug fixes.Details: \n\nClass changes\n\nSince always but specially after the reboots archer has been a large scale focused class focused on decimating enemies in a long range while being weaker in lower scales or 1v1 fights. However in the current meta, the class is too good in large scale but one of the worst classes in 1v1, 5v5 or Arena of Solare. \n-\nThis being said, lets talk about the large scale. At the moment archer is a really good large scale class with a lot of fragging potential, but there is one skill all archer agree it should be tuned down a bit, not because of its damage, but because of its AoE. \n-\nFlow: Grand Bloom: After the reboots this skill made possible what every archer wanted, ranged utility for our obsolete Full Bloom, and it did it well, way too well, is it so that it covers an AoE of 120º with a 20º arrow spread, allowing not only hitting the full enemy raid but killing enemies that we aren't even aware of them. To fix this the skill should lose the outer arrows, making it 5 arrows instead of 7 and should gather the other 5 in the current AoE covered by the inner arrows, 40º with a 10º arrow spread. This idea would make the archer able to hit whoever is aiming at, as the current skill does, but without being so threatening for the whole enemy raid and targets we are not even aiming at. Here 2 images about Flow: Grand Bloom, current and after the change.\n-\nCurrent Flow: Grand Bloom: https://imgur.com/a/3EcLUL3\nAfter change Flow: Grand Bloom: https://imgur.com/a/bDEPIAc\n-\nAs I mentioned earlier, archer is one of the worst small scale classes, needing to greatly over skill your enemies to be able to deal with them, this is mostly due to the archer's tankiness. Archer has a great kit, designed to be slippery in good hands, but in the current state of the game, and probably aiming to the future, archer lacks defensive stats to deal with the enemies. This last also extends to PvE, being one of the classes that has the hardest times in the highest end-game PvE spots, as Crypt, Quint's hill etc This reaches a point where even a trial character can kill a c20 archer, in 1.7 CCs. Here a link where you can observe how squishy the archer is: https://streamable.com/oa07mg\n-\nAs you can watch, a lazy combo from a trial awakening Drakania (277 ap bracket) that is not the class with the highest dmg, specially on trials, was so easy to end the life of an archer with end-game dp hence archer's super armors are not a viable protection at this moment, since archer will get killed through them in 2 skills.\n-\nThat's why I'd like to suggest increasing the archer's base damage reduction by 25 and an increase of 300 HP at lvl 63( I don't have the data to write how much extra HP per level is this). This would keep archer squishy enough to enemy attacks but would help him to survive a little longer and specially in PvE, It would allow archer to face better end-game spots.\n-\nNow lets talk about \"Sunfall\": It was a skill designed to help archer's performance specially in end-game PvE spots, but the main issue with this skill is its range is too short and its AoE is way too small, often the mobs go out of the area of the skill or the skill just can't reach every mob within the pull. Another issue with this skill is the inability to aim the skill. It has a fixed range, if you are a step too far it won't hit correctly the pull, and if you are too close it will completely miss.\n-\nThe best take would be allowing the players to aim the skill and increasing the AoE of the skill by 50%, about the range, the skill should have the same max range as \"Earth shatter\", which is not too long, but comfortable enough to use it without having to take extra steps to finish off the pull.\n-\n-\nQuality of Life changes \n-\n-Remove RMB input from Flow: Light's Trail and Righteous Smite, it saves from missclicks committed during fast or stressful gameplay.\n-Remove the F input from Radiant Explosion and Righteous Smite, it saves from missclicks committed during fast or stressful gameplay.\n-Allow to hold Luthraghon's Call and Piercing Light when \"Watcher\" is active, makes no sense not having this option.\n-Remove the recoil from Nature Shattering Arrow and Bolt of Radiance, it greatly helps with fights in uneven terrain.\n-Increase the height where falling animation starts when using Flow: Piercing Cry and Uproot, this will allow using the skill in uneven terrain.\n-Allow to swap core skills when \"Watcher\" is in CD or when its locked, self explanatory.\n-\nBug reports\n-\n-Fix the inability to use Bolt of Radiance and Wrath of Nature after using Flow: Piercing Cry to swap from awakening. Video example: https://streamable.com/gtxaoh\n-Fix the inability to use any skill when using exhale with the \"Side+E\" input. Sometimes the skill bugs and the character is unable to perform any action other than walking for few seconds. Video examples: https://streamable.com/6av8u3 https://streamable.com/tx3udf https://streamable.com/kwjunq\n-Fix the inability to use Meteor Dive after using Black Spirit: Radiant Explosion, it makes the archer perform a normal jump if you try it.
